I just returned from four weeks of vacation‚Äîno laptop, no programming books, and a phone that could barely do more than call and text. It‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve been away from code in years. I didn‚Äôt plan to make it a digital detox, but it turned out to be exactly what I needed. If you do get a chance to do the same, I'd highly recommend it!

There‚Äôs something clarifying about stepping away from the things that usually fill your days. For me, that meant no late-night debugging, no ‚Äújust one more chapter‚Äù of a programming book, and no side projects. Instead, I spent my sitting-down time reading more fiction, playing more Zelda, and generally letting my mind wander more than usual. It was good.

But as the days went by, I found myself reflecting on what it means to be passionate about programming‚Äîand how that passion fits into the bigger picture of a meaningful career. If you‚Äôve read my earlier post, ["Passion"](/posts/passion/), you know I care deeply about loving what you do. But lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about the _order_ of things: does passion come first, or is it something that grows as you get really good at your craft?

## The Craftsman Mindset

Enter Cal Newport‚Äôs excellent book, ["So Good They Can't Ignore You"](https://amzn.to/40MY6YX). If you haven‚Äôt read it, I highly recommend picking up a copy. Newport challenges the common advice to ‚Äúfollow your passion,‚Äù arguing that this mindset can actually be counterproductive‚Äîespecially in fields like programming.

Instead, he advocates for what he calls the **craftsman mindset**: focusing on getting really, _really_ good at something valuable, and letting passion grow as a result of mastery. In other words, don‚Äôt start by asking ‚ÄúWhat am I passionate about?‚Äù‚Äîstart by asking ‚ÄúHow can I get better at this?‚Äù Passion, Newport argues, is often the _result_ of putting in the hard work to become excellent.

This resonates with me, especially after a month away from the keyboard. I realized that what I missed most wasn‚Äôt the _idea_ of being a programmer, but the satisfaction that comes from solving tricky problems, learning new things, and seeing my skills improve over time. That‚Äôs the craftsman mindset in action. Add to that, I didn't know I was (or even could be!) passionate about programming until I was knee deep in (I started out as a cinematographer, believe it or not).

(As the veteran reader very well knows, [it's not exactly the first time I intentionally use the word "Craft" about software engineering](/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym/). I think it's exactly the right term.)

## Passion Still Matters

Of course, I still believe passion is important. (If you want to know why, check out my earlier post: ["Passion"](/posts/passion/).) But Newport‚Äôs point is that passion is often the _fruit_ of craftsmanship, not the seed. In programming, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the search for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù job or the most exciting technology. But the real joy comes from the slow, steady process of getting better‚Äîof building things that matter, and knowing you‚Äôve done them well.

## The Order of Things

So here‚Äôs my takeaway, coming back from vacation: Don‚Äôt stress about finding your one true passion. Instead, focus on the work in front of you. Get good‚Äî_so good they can‚Äôt ignore you_. Passion will follow.

There's a lot more to say on this, but Cal Newport says it best. So, to summarize:

If you‚Äôre looking for a great read to finish off your summer, one that might change the way you think about your career, give Cal Newport‚Äôs book a try: ["So Good They Can't Ignore You"](https://amzn.to/40MY6YX). He's also blogged extensively on the topic, so if you prefer a more bullet point-y version, check out his [Career Craftsman Manifesto](https://calnewport.com/the-career-craftsman-manifesto/).

Also: It's good to be back. I can't wait to continue on my Elm project. Without AI auto-complete. ü§ìü§§
