My podcast "Dønn Disippel" is usually both off topic and not least _wrong language_ to mention much on this blog (though there _is_ a link on top next to the Norwegian flag). Until now, that is! This latest episode is in English, which means I can finally show (and not just tell) my international audience some of what I'm up to. Still off topic, sure, but now you at least know what it is.

In this episode, we're visiting Chuck Parry of Bethel Church (Redding, CA). What an honor!
