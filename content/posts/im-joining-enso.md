## My favorite consultancy

I'm thrilled to share that I'll be joining my favorite consultancy this coming February!

There's not much more to add, except that it feels fantastic to have signed and secured this next chapter of my future. I had some intriguing opportunities along the way, but Ens≈ç stands out as a rare gem‚Äînot just for the excellent terms and usual perks, but especially for the amazing people who make it an extraordinary company.

I wish I could show you the stuff I made for their tech interview, but I guess I can't. Suffice to say it was quite a lot of ~~work~~ fun!

## Sabbatical vol 2

I'm also thrilled that I'm not starting right away. The last part of my sabbatical, I suspect, will be even better than the first. Now that all is signed and settled, I can detach even more, and be as offline as I want. Oh, joy!

‚Äì Peace out ü§§
