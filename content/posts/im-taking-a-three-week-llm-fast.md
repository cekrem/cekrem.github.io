## I'm not that addicted. Am I?

I don't use agents for coding. [I love my craft far too much](/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym). Don't get me wrong, I've of course tried it. But every time I felt the worse for it afterwards, learned less than nothing, and [ended up with code I neither owned or understood completely](/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/). Yuck. Nevertheless, LLMs have been sneaking into various workflows without my being completely intentional about it. My mantra has been to use it like Python scripts, to "automate (or simplify/streamline) the boring parts" while keeping it at arms length from everything I truly care about. But "boring" is a woolly and dynamic term, and I find myself growing lazy in more ways than I'd planned. I suspect my brain is shutting down various faculties whenever I don't bother finishing a sentence in my notes, summarizing longer parts of text or wraiting slopppy because some LLM will proof read things afterwards anyway. It's a bit like when Frodo slips on his ring to get out of a tough spot. It seems to solve an immediate problem quite efficiently, but every time Sauron closes in (and it's actually _never_ worth it).

Enough of that.

## Detox time

Fasting is a quite efficient means to rid ourselves of various addictions, to intentionally starve our "lesser hungers" in order to bring our deeper ones into clearer focus. See, that's not a bad sentence, right there, and no LLM refined it or articulated it on demand. I suspect this fast will do me good, and possibly unearth an uncomfortable reality that shows that I've become far more entangled in the quickfix life of LLM answers than I ever set out to be. I'm reminded of the many heartbreaking moments of both Blade Runner movies, when someone (something?) who thought they were Human found out to their own dismay that they weren't after all, they were but sophisticated machines. But I am. Human, I mean. And I rather be that. And I rather be bored at times, than turn off more and more parts of my human brain to save... what, exactly?

**So for the rest of November, I'll do even the most mundane of tasks by hand. No GPT, no Claude, no nothing.** Like typing out the front-matter (metadata) for this blog post:

(I'll change the `draft` bool before you read this, obviously, but you get the idea.)

## And my book?

Listen, I'll probably run things by one of the usual suspects after a while. After all, proof reading and _language_ in general is something an AI can actually excel at (second L in LLM, remember?)! But my favorite part of writing [my Elm for React developers book](https://leanpub.com/elm-for-react-devs) is when I'm putting on my favorite playlist, and I'm all alone with `vim`.
