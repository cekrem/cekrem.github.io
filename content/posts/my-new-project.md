## Dear subscriber

I haven't forgotten about you. Quite the contrary â€“ I've been meaning to let you know (in a meaningful way) why there have been fewer posts lately. And, to be clear: neither have I stopped writing (again, quite the contrary).

I'd like nothing else than to give faithful readers and subscribers the front row seat, and to ask your kind and insightful feedback, when the time comes.
