# The best tool for note-taking?

The one you have close at hand. ReMarkable this, vintage inherited bio-dynamic paper that – it'll do you no good what-so-ever if it's not readily available when you need it. I've spent way too much time trying to find the "ideal" solution for keeping track of notes and ideas through my workday. But all I _really_ need is this:

- To jot down new notes and ideas _fast!_.
- To search through previous notes equally fast.

# What could possibly be better...

...Than to create notes from the comfort of your beloved terminal that's already open anyway, and to do super-fast full text fuzzy searches in all you've ever written? Did I mention it's fast?

If you prefer to write things down on paper, and never ever **a)** lose your precious Moleskin or **b)** forget to _always_ bring said Moleskin at all times, then bless your soul. Read no further, go on with your made up life. If not, please [do enjoy](https://github.com/cekrem/ripnote):

```
$ yarn global add ripnote
```

or

```
$ npm install -g ripnote
```

And then:
