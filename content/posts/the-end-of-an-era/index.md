The Day Has Come. I'm officially archiving my previous [development plan](/posts/devplan) and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It's been a long time coming, and I'm happy to say that I've achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I've learned a lot, and I'm ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I'm not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet. So consider this post ceremonial more than anything.

## Level 3 -> Level 4: âˆš

Today's beer will undoubtedly have the taste of victory, and be labeled "**Christian Ekrem, ~~Senior~~ Staff Engineer @ Vipps Mobile Pay**". Thanks for watching :D
