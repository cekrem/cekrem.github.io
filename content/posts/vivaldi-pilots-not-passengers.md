## Wait, a company actually said this?

A few weeks ago, someone bought me three beers through the widget on my site. Their message said they were "being very positively challenged by your writing on AI" and that they also loved functional programming and valued the craft. So I know I'm not alone in feeling weird about the current AI-in-everything zeitgeist.

But individuals agreeing with you is one thing. A company saying it out loud? That's different.

Vivaldi just released version 7.8, and instead of the usual "we added AI features because everyone else did" announcement, they went the opposite direction. Their message to Big Tech? "Humans don't need AI babysitters."

You can say that again!

## The actual quote

Vivaldi's CEO Jon von Tetzchner:

> "The entire browser industry is solving the wrong problem. They're building assistants that filter what you see, decide what you don't need."

Browsing should "light up your brain, not numb it." Outsourcing exploration to algorithms means "you're not browsing anymore."

A browser company, publicly saying: we think you're capable of thinking for yourself. Wild.

## Head, not tail

Vivaldi frames it as treating users as "pilots" rather than "passengers." I like that, but I think of it differently: be the head, not the tail.

Instead of AI deciding what you should see, Vivaldi builds actual tools: drag-and-drop tab tiling, domain-restricted pinned tabs, workspaces you control. Tools that extend what you can do, not tools that decide what you should do.

I've written about this before. When [Shopify's CEO called for "reflexive AI usage"](/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym), my reaction was visceral: that sounds like a diagnosis, not a goal. The whole point of craft is that _you_ do the work. You struggle and you learn. Outsourcing that to an algorithm isn't efficiency, it's atrophy.

## Going against the grain

Every major browser is racing to add AI features. Chrome has Gemini. Edge has Copilot. Safari is probably cooking something up. The industry consensus is clear: AI in everything, everywhere, all at once.

And here's Vivaldi saying: actually, no. We spent our engineering time on "stability and features users requested. Not on AI assistants that hallucinate answers while training on your private browsing."

That last part is spicy. And accurate.

## My own weird crusade

Last year I [stripped my iPhone down to the essentials](/posts/dumbing-down-my-iphone/) using Apple Configurator because I was tired of my phone trying to be "helpful" in ways I didn't ask for. More recently, I [took a three-week break from LLMs entirely](/posts/im-taking-a-three-week-llm-fast/) just to remember what my own brain felt like without the crutch.

Same idea, really. I want to be the one in control. There's a difference between a hammer and an autopilot, and too much of modern software wants to be the latter.

Vivaldi gets this. Give users actual tools and trust them to use those tools. Rare stance these days.

## What I'm not saying

I'm not saying AI is useless. I use it for boring stuff all the time. [Boilerplate, documentation, data munging](/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym/) - the parts of work that don't require my full engagement. AI existing isn't the issue. AI being forced into places where I'd rather think for myself? That's the issue.

When I browse the web, I want to decide what's interesting. Follow rabbit holes that seem weird. Stumble onto things an algorithm would never recommend because my browsing history doesn't "support" it. That's where the good stuff lives.

An AI assistant filtering my experience "for my own good" isn't helping. It's just... sad.

## So yeah

While everyone else competes to see who can stuff more AI into their products, Vivaldi is betting that some people still want to think for themselves.

I'm one of those people. Maybe you are too.

I'll probably run this post through an LLM before publishing, for what it's worth. (Or maybe I shouldn't?) But that's kind of the point, isn't it? I ask for help when I want it. The tool doesn't get to decide for me. Please catch my typos and grammatical slips, but don't tell me what/how to write!

So thank you, Vivaldi, for making software better instead of humans dumber!
