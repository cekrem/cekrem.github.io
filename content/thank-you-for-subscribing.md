## Welcome aboard!

You did it. You actually subscribed. That means you're now part of a small, exclusive group of people who'll get my posts straight to their inbox—before I share them anywhere else. I promise to only bother you when I have something worth saying. (Most of the time, anyway.)

## A little thank-you gift

Since you're clearly a person of excellent taste, here's something special: I'm working on a book called **An Elm Primer for React Developers**—a practical guide to learning functional programming without the academic headaches.

As a subscriber, you can **[grab it for just $5 instead of $29](https://leanpub.com/elm-for-react-devs/c/subscriber)**.

Thanks for joining. Looking forward to having you along for the ride!
