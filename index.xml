&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1" >part 1&lt;/a>, I made a small POC cli tool for doing multiple things in parallel. Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it. My adventures in part 2 have, however, been slightly shipwrecked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring UIs in the terminal part 1: React/Ink</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="where-do-uis-belong">

&lt;p>Most of us consider ReactJS a tool for rendering UI components on the web (or the DOM, specifically), and if by &amp;ldquo;React&amp;rdquo; we mean &amp;ldquo;ReactDOM&amp;rdquo; then we&amp;rsquo;re right. But as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with React Native, React is not confined to the DOM at all, and can render to any number of environments. After all, like it says on the box, React is a &amp;ldquo;JavaScript library for building user interfaces&amp;rdquo;. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same with &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compose Multiplatform&lt;/a>: what used to be a framework for creating Android UI can actually be used for so much more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The End of an Era!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/back-to-the-old-gym" >Here&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s the next development plan, kind of.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Day Has Come. I&amp;rsquo;m officially archiving my previous &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan" >development plan&lt;/a> and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;m not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet. So consider this post ceremonial more than anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development plan 2021-2023</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: This plan is now archived.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been at &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a> since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &amp;ldquo;Merchant Core&amp;rdquo; team. I
created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (
let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps
Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted a Vipps Community Of
Practice plainly called &amp;ldquo;Side Projects And Experiments&amp;rdquo; (SPÆ) where I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on quite a lot of exciting tech and
tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work has been with Golang and React. And

&lt;p>The original Light Phone was a seriously dumb device. No texting, only phone calls. The company behind it never meant for it to be your only device, but a device to bring when you were &amp;ldquo;going light&amp;rdquo; – detaching yourself from all the digital clutter of your everyday (social media, feeds, notifications ++). It was a big a hit as one might expect, I guess, but quite a few people found the experience delightfully refreshing – but definitely not sustainable. After all, we need a few more bare essentials than just phone calls. Right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ripnote – the fastest and fuzziest way for a developer to take notes</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/ripnote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 13:35:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/ripnote/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-best-tool-for-note-taking">

The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else. This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to &lt;em>say&lt;/em> that you&amp;rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reducing Android Build Times on Azure by 80% using a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/reducing-android-build-times-on-azure-by-80/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 12:00:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/reducing-android-build-times-on-azure-by-80/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

With a weekly release schedule, that might not sound like a huge dealbreaker, but since we&amp;rsquo;re using a &amp;ldquo;feature branch&amp;rdquo; approach to how we do &lt;code>git&lt;/code> (ie no &lt;code>develop&lt;/code> branch; &lt;code>master&lt;/code> should always be deployable-ish), we don&amp;rsquo;t allow merging &lt;em>anything&lt;/em> to &lt;code>master&lt;/code> without a successful cloud build. Waiting for code review is hard to avoid, but additionally waiting for slow builds is just wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy for our internal testers to check out what we&amp;rsquo;re doing either, they &lt;em>too&lt;/em> are kept waiting. Suffice to say, the pain has been real. Personally, coming from a Golang background (where builds happen at the speed of your monitor&amp;rsquo;s refresh rate), this kind of wrecked my soul on a daily basis. Granted, Android builds are more complicated (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, Java ecosystem!) than single-binary Golang builds, but 40+ minutes for one app build is too slow nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>React Advent Calendar – keto vegan, gluten free and no parabens or plastic wrapping</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/react-advent-calendar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/react-advent-calendar/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="tldr-i-made-an-advent-calendar-in-react-my-wife-loved-it">

While I&amp;rsquo;ve not consistently been very good at paying this forward, I do make an effort some years to do something a bit different for my wife. Yes, my wife; the kids get standard ones :P This year&amp;rsquo;s plan was simple: create an online calendar with cozy favors, encouragements and the like each day until Christmas. I had planned to spend exactly one evening on this - the last evening of November, to be precise. But, my wife&amp;rsquo;s plans for the evening evaporated as she decided she &amp;ldquo;really wanted to hang out with me at home&amp;rdquo; instead. Needless to say, I had to work quite fast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hire me: Your Chief Problem Solver</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/hire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/hire/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="who-i-am">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering a bit with Elm lately. The super-enforced functional and minimal paradigm is very refreshing, and serves as a sort of detox after spending one too many hour stuck in Android&amp;rsquo;s not-so-lovely XML + mutating class world. Setting up a new bare minimum Elm app should be quite simple, but it turns out that there are a few more steps required than one would expect. My first instinct – being a React guy – was to try &lt;code>yarn create elm-app&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>npx create-elm-app&lt;/code>), hoping it would do the Elm-equivalent of what &lt;code>create-react-app&lt;/code> does. Turns out, to my disappointment, that the end result leaves something to be desired. No proper live-reload out of the box, and a lot of the webpack stuff I was hoping to avoid completely with Elm. Yuck.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-floats-my-boat">
