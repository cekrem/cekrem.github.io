      <title>Programming as Theory Building, Part II: When Institutions Crumble</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/" >previous post on Peter Naur&rsquo;s &ldquo;Programming as Theory Building&rdquo;</a>, I argued that a program is not its source code—it&rsquo;s the shared mental model held by the people who built it. When those people leave (or never understood it in the first place), the theory dies, and you&rsquo;re left with a codebase that works but nobody truly comprehends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this more, and I&rsquo;ve come to believe the problem goes deeper than individual developers losing their edge. It&rsquo;s not just that <em>people</em> are losing the ability to build theories. It&rsquo;s that the <em>institutions</em> where theory-building happens—our teams, our companies, our profession—are being systematically degraded.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Arrow's Either: The Kotlin Chapter of our Scary Words Saga</title>

<p>A few weeks back I wrote about <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/functors-applicatives-monads-elm/" >functors, applicatives, and monads in Elm</a> – those three terrifying terms that make developers&rsquo; eyes glaze over. The punchline was simple: if you&rsquo;ve used <code>map</code>, <code>map2</code>, or <code>andThen</code>, you already know these concepts. You just didn&rsquo;t know they had fancy names.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: I spend a lot of my day-to-day in Kotlin, not Elm. And Kotlin has its own functional programming story, largely thanks to a library called <a href="https://arrow-kt.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arrow</a>. So I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to see how the same concepts translate.</p>]]></description>

<p>Happy new year! Good to be back. What better way to kickstart this year than to scare you to death with the three most dreaded words in computer science since <code>NullPointerException</code>?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time around functional programming communities, you&rsquo;ve encountered <em>them</em>. Elodin in The Kingkiller Chronicles claims there are Seven Words to make a woman love you, and there are definitely three words that make junior developers&rsquo; eyes glaze over. The concepts that spawn a thousand Medium articles with titles like &ldquo;Monads Explained with Burritos&rdquo; (not kidding). The triforce of functional programming jargon: <strong>Functors</strong>, <strong>Applicatives</strong>, and <strong>Monads</strong>.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Elm on the Backend with Node.js: An Experiment in Opaque Values</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What if you could write backend logic in Elm? Not &ldquo;Elm-like&rdquo; or &ldquo;inspired by Elm&rdquo; – actual Elm, with the compiler, the types, the whole package. I&rsquo;ve been nerd-sniped by this idea for a while, and last night I finally sat down to build a proof of concept.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is me experimenting with a concept, not suggesting anyone <em>should</em> do this. If you actually want Elm on the backend, <a href="https://lamdera.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lamdera</a> does something far more sophisticated – it&rsquo;s a full platform with seamless frontend/backend Elm, automatic persistence, and real deployment story. My thing is&hellip; not that. It&rsquo;s just a hack to see what&rsquo;s possible with vanilla Node.js and vanilla Elm, nothing more.</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit my first reaction was a grin. Go is one of those languages I genuinely enjoy working with - simple, pragmatic, fast. My second reaction was &ldquo;wait, 10x faster?&rdquo; And my third was &ldquo;okay, this makes a lot of sense actually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was at this Christmas lunch with some co-workers the other day, and our conversation turned – through no conscious effort of my own – towards things regarding the Christian faith, and the different terms we use and how they sometimes differ from their biblical definitions. Like &ldquo;Church&rdquo; – is it a building, or a group of people following Jesus? Or &ldquo;Priest&rdquo;, is that an occupation, something you graduate from seminary to become, or is it a general term including all of God&rsquo;s people? At some point a colleague noted that &ldquo;hey, Christian, you seem to be more engaged and deliberate about your faith than most people I know. Why is that?&rdquo;.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Tailwind CSS: Targeting Child Elements (when you have to)</title>
      <link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/tailwind-targeting-child-elements/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/tailwind-targeting-child-elements/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The whole point of Tailwind is applying utility classes directly to elements. Styling generic elements like <code>p</code> or <code>div</code> with descendant selectors goes against the grain—it&rsquo;s the kind of thing Tailwind was designed to replace.</p>
<p>But sometimes you don&rsquo;t have a choice. Maybe it&rsquo;s content from a CMS, a third-party component, or dynamically generated HTML. You need to style elements you don&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s be clear upfront:</strong> adding a small piece of vanilla CSS to handle this is often the simplest and most sensible solution. A dedicated stylesheet for CMS content is a perfectly valid approach. But if you&rsquo;re committed to staying within Tailwind&rsquo;s utility-class paradigm—or just curious about what&rsquo;s possible—this post shows how you <em>can</em> target child elements using arbitrary variants.</p>]]></description>

      <title>cekrem/elm-form: Type-Safe Forms That Won't Let You Mess Up</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I just published <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/cekrem/elm-form/1.0.0/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cekrem/elm-form</a> – a package for building HTML forms in Elm with type safety, validation, and a clean API. If you&rsquo;ve ever written forms in Elm (or any language, really), you know they can get messy fast. This package tries to make them less so, without including too many arbitrary batteries.</p>

<p>Forms are everywhere, and they&rsquo;re usually tedious to build. You need labels, inputs, validation, error handling, accessibility attributes, and somehow it all needs to stay in sync. <code>elm-form</code> gives you a declarative way to build forms that handles the boilerplate while keeping things type-safe.</p>]]></description>

      <title>An Elm Primer: The missing chapter on JavaScript interop</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a week off from working with my book, mainly to celebrate the initial completion of parts I and II (out of IV). But it turns out I had a slight <code>git push</code> connection error on my private Macbook after adding the last chapter so what I actually published was less than all of part II: chapter 8 on ports and javascript interop was missing.</p>
<p>This serves as a reminder that the outside world is not to be trusted, and that any interaction and side-effect can (and will, from time to time) fail – even something as ordinary as a <code>git push</code>. Which happens to be a major theme in the missing chapter, humbly presented to you below.</p>]]></description>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use agents for coding. <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym" >I love my craft far too much</a>. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve of course tried it. But every time I felt the worse for it afterwards, learned less than nothing, and <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/" >ended up with code I neither owned or understood completely</a>. Yuck. Nevertheless, LLMs have been sneaking into various workflows without my being completely intentional about it. My mantra has been to use it like Python scripts, &ldquo;to automate (or simplify/streamline) the boring parts&rdquo; while keeping it at arms length from everything I truly care about. But &ldquo;boring&rdquo; is a woolly and dynamic term, and I find myself growing lazy in more ways than I&rsquo;d planned, as well as more easily bored. I suspect my brain is shutting down various faculties whenever I don&rsquo;t bother finishing a sentence in my notes, summarizing longer parts of text or wraiting slopppy because some LLM will proof read things afterwards anyway. It&rsquo;s a bit like when Frodo slips on his ring to get out of a tough spot. It seems to solve an immediate problem quite efficiently, but every time Sauron closes in (and it&rsquo;s actually <em>never</em> worth it).</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>TypeScript won&rsquo;t save you from yourself.</p>
<p>I know this sounds harsh, especially if you&rsquo;ve invested years mastering generics, conditional types, and mapped types. But the green checkmark from the TypeScript compiler means your code is consistent with itself - not that it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attack on TypeScript, but rather a proverbial sledgehammer to the belief that types equal type safety.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the tool. It&rsquo;s the mindset. I see it constantly: developers who stop thinking about edge cases because &ldquo;the types will catch it,&rdquo; who skip validation because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s typed,&rdquo; who trust the compiler too much.</p>]]></description>

<p>Not because the original was &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;&quot;, but because the frame was off. I started by putting Elm and React side by side, trying to show “the Elm way” next to “the React way.” It felt tidy. It also pushed me into an awkward corner: either I write React the way I used to (which would undercut credibility with seasoned React developers), or I write the best React I can with everything I’ve learned from years in Elm (which would quietly disprove half my own argument). That tension is the point of this rewrite.</p>]]></description>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a question that comes up occasionally in Elm Land projects: <em>How do I react when something in the <code>Shared</code> model changes?</em></p>
<p>It sounds simple enough. You have some global state in <code>Shared.Model</code> - maybe feature flags loaded from the backend, authentication status, or some configuration data. Your page needs to <em>do something</em> when that data changes. Not just render differently (that&rsquo;s trivial), but actually perform an effect - fire off a new HTTP request, trigger some side effect locally, or whatever.</p>]]></description>

The struggle against screen addiction and digital death is real, and it takes a great deal of intentionality to keep my various smart devices on a leash, making sure I&rsquo;m the head and not the tail!</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about discipline lately. Not the &ldquo;wake up at 5 AM and eat nothing but kale&rdquo; kind, but the more interesting variety: the kind that comes from working within constraints that make bad choices impossible.</p>
<p>After spending several months deep in Elm land - where the compiler is your strict but helpful mentor - I returned to a React codebase that was enthusiastically using <code>useReducer</code> everywhere. The whiplash was immediate and instructive.</p>]]></description>

      <title>HTML Helpers 2.0.0 for Elm: Stable conditionals and attributes</title>
      <link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/html-helpers-2-0-0-for-elm/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in May, I introduced a tiny Elm package of HTML utilities focused on reducing boilerplate and improving readability. Since then, I’ve been using it in a few projects and gathering feedback. Today I’m releasing version 2.0.0, which finalizes the core API: concise conditionals for single elements and attribute utilities—as well as the 1.x stuff for lists.</p>
<p>If you want to skim the exact changes from 1.3.2 to 2.0.0, here’s the comparison: <a href="https://github.com/cekrem/html-helpers/compare/1.3.2..2.0.0" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.3.2..2.0.0</a>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I originally wanted to write a post about Server-Sent Events in general, and how delightfully cool they are. SSE provides a clean, standardized way for servers to push real-time updates to web clients over a simple HTTP connection. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN documentation</a> showcases how straightforward the client-side implementation is, while <a href="https://ktor.io/docs/server-server-sent-events.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ktor&rsquo;s SSE support</a> makes the server-side equally elegant. SSE strikes a perfect balance: simpler than WebSockets when you only need one-way communication, yet more efficient than polling.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>At KotlinConf 2025, the Kotlin team showcased progress toward <strong>Rich Errors</strong> with union types. After years of watching languages slowly adopt patterns that Elm has championed since day one, it&rsquo;s exciting to see Kotlin taking this significant step toward more explicit, type-safe error handling. And in a very &ldquo;native&rdquo; Kotlin way at that!</p>
<p>I vividly remember this announcement giving my functional heart a pleasant jolt, but I haven&rsquo;t found the time for a write-up until now. Better late than never, though:</p>]]></description>

      <guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/on-the-value-of-abstractions/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Most of my day-to-day work is in Elm. The combination of a functional language and the Elm Architecture makes many architectural decisions almost invisible (I talk more about that <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/#the-elm-architecture-vs-clean-architecture" >in this blog post</a>). You get a clear separation of concerns, and the language nudges you toward good design by default.</p>
<p>But my work isn’t limited to Elm. I frequently find myself building features that span both frontend and backend—writing new endpoints, and sometimes even designing new database tables. When I step outside the Elm world, I’m reminded that architecture is something I have to be intentional about again.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I just returned from four weeks of vacation—no laptop, no programming books, and a phone that could barely do more than call and text. It’s the longest I’ve been away from code in years. I didn’t plan to make it a digital detox, but it turned out to be exactly what I needed. If you do get a chance to do the same, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it!</p>
<p>There’s something clarifying about stepping away from the things that usually fill your days. For me, that meant no late-night debugging, no “just one more chapter” of a programming book, and no side projects. Instead, I spent my sitting-down time reading more fiction, playing more Zelda, and generally letting my mind wander more than usual. It was good.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Programming as Theory Building: Why Senior Developers Are More Valuable Than Ever</title>

      <guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1985, computer scientist Peter Naur wrote a prescient essay called <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Programming as Theory Building&rdquo;</a> that feels more relevant today than ever. As we watch junior developers reflexively accept LLM-generated code they don&rsquo;t understand, and see codebases balloon with theoretically orphaned implementations, Naur&rsquo;s central thesis becomes crystal clear: <strong>a program is not its source code</strong>.</p>

 <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
 <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
 </a>
</h2>
<p>Naur argues that programming is fundamentally about building a theory—a <strong>shared mental model</strong> of how a system works, why it works that way, and how it should evolve. The source code is merely a written representation of this theory, and like all representations, it&rsquo;s lossy. Critical knowledge about intent, design decisions, trade-offs, and the reasoning behind architectural choices exists only in the minds of the people who built the system.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s awesome to learn Elm by building a side project, you absolutely should. And maybe you have – perhaps you&rsquo;ve built a todo app, explored The Elm Architecture, and fallen in love with the reliability and maintainability that comes with functional programming and strong types.</p>
<p>But come Monday morning, you&rsquo;re back to wrestling with JavaScript bugs, runtime errors, and the nagging feeling that there has to be a better way. The problem isn&rsquo;t that Elm isn&rsquo;t ready for production work – it absolutely is. The problem is convincing your team, your boss, or your organization to take the leap. And when you&rsquo;re thinking about wholesale replacement, your boss&rsquo;s skepticism might be quite healthy. But here&rsquo;s the thing: if you reduce the scope, you can also reduce the risk and buy-in required. Instead of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s rebuild our entire app in Elm,&rdquo; what if the conversation was &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try Elm for this one small widget&rdquo;? Suddenly, the stakes drop dramatically.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s Friday, and I&rsquo;m up at 4am, wide awake, head filled with thoughts on recursive data structures and how to efficiently deal with them in our client&rsquo;s Elm application. I tried going back to sleep for a few minutes, but decided against it. My (Garmin) sleep score averages well above 90%, so I can deal with one slightly short night. <em>If I can just solve this puzzle</em>, it&rsquo;ll be more than worth it! I&rsquo;m doing test driven development on this particular problem. Not because I want to be fancy or make a point, but out of necessity – the complexity is far beyond what I would entrust myself without some guard rails while I iterate on it. <strong>It feels great</strong>, and I&rsquo;m already looking forward to the Sabbath moment when I can behold the work of my hands and see that it was good.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the Elm ecosystem, the browser is treated like an I/O device. DOM events, JavaScript interop, and even network requests are kept outside the core logic. Rather than allowing side effects to permeate the codebase, Elm channels them through strictly typed boundaries known as <em>ports</em>.</p>
<p>This architectural stance is both radical and liberating. It allows you to build user interfaces where logic remains pure, testable, and robust, even as surrounding technologies evolve.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of React development, we often find ourselves writing components that are tightly coupled to their dependencies. This makes testing difficult, maintenance a challenge, and change nearly impossible.

<p>When React applications start to slow down, <code>React.memo</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useCallback</code> are often the first tools developers reach for. After all, preventing unnecessary re-renders seems like a straightforward path to better performance. But in the React ecosystem, memoization is far more complex than it first appears.</p>
<p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at how these tools actually work under the hood, the subtle ways they can fail, and when they&rsquo;re truly beneficial versus when they&rsquo;re just adding unnecessary complexity.</p>]]></description>

<p>When dealing with large lists or complex DOM structures, performance optimization often feels like a complex puzzle. But sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most effective. Enter <code>content-visibility: auto</code> - a CSS property that can dramatically improve rendering performance with minimal effort.</p>
<p>You can (and IMHO should) read all about it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>! 🤓</p>

<p><code>content-visibility: auto</code> tells the browser to skip rendering elements that are not currently visible in the viewport. It&rsquo;s like having a virtual scroll implementation, but without the complexity of managing scroll positions or item heights manually.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common questions I get about Elm is: &ldquo;How do I integrate it with existing JavaScript ecosystems?&rdquo; While Elm&rsquo;s isolation is a strength, real-world projects often require working with external libraries, APIs, or UI components. Doing incremental migration is also the recommended way to introduce Elm, and luckily there are may ways to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll show you how to combine two powerful technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Elm Ports</strong>: The official way to communicate between Elm and JavaScript</li>
<li><strong>Web Components</strong>: Standard, framework-agnostic UI components</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination gives us the best of both worlds: Elm&rsquo;s type safety and predictable architecture alongside the reusability and interoperability of Web Components. Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>]]></description>

<p>When it comes to React performance optimization, <code>React.memo</code> is often the first tool developers reach for.

But what if I told you that in many cases, there are simpler, more elegant solutions that align better with React&rsquo;s compositional nature?</p>
<p>Today, I want to explore some fundamental concepts about how React renders components and share composition patterns that can dramatically improve performance without the complexity and gotchas of memoization.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a world dominated by React, Vue, and Svelte, it might seem strange to highlight Elm – a niche language that has existed since 2012 but has had fewer releases since then than React has in a year. But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.</p>]]></description>

<p>In our <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/clean-architecture-and-plugins-in-go" >previous post</a>, we explored the Dependency Inversion Principle and how it enables clean, modular architectures. Today, let&rsquo;s dive into another crucial SOLID principle: Interface Segregation.</p>
<p>Again, kudos to Uncle Bob for reminding me about the importance of good <strong>software architecture</strong> in his classic <a href="https://amzn.to/4iAc8o1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Architecture</a>!

<p><strong>Update: this has become a series, the next entry can be found here: <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/interface-segregation-in-practice/" >Interface Segregation: Why Your Interfaces Should Be Small and Focused</a></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lately enjoyed revisiting the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLID Design Principles</a>. In the world of software architecture, few principles have stood the test of time like these. I find the &ldquo;Dependency Inversion Principle&rdquo; particularly interesting, as it&rsquo;s one of the few that are either forgotten in modern applications, or drowned in so much over-engineering that the cost/benefit equation is offset anyways.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4gAOaHa" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a> – Not a programming / software engineering book at all per say, but a <em>highly</em> recommended read regardless. If you read one book on this list, go for this one, for real.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3VIleoE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZZu3Ny" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code<em>r</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4iAc8o1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Architecture</a> — These Uncle Bob classics are great. I&rsquo;m currently enjoying the architecture one <em>on audible</em>, that&rsquo;s a first for me with a software engineering book. Simply great, and truly a pleasant read/listen.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4gjf4Ud" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery</a> — A classic, and a good one at that!</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/41GYOrQ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track</a> — This one I find a tiny bit boring, to be perfectly honest, but still very helpful. Lot&rsquo;s of insight about &ldquo;all the other stuff&rdquo; (not coding).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4gjc9ex" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact</a> — I haven&rsquo;t read this one yet, but it&rsquo;s been highly recommended to me by trustworthy people. And how about that killer subtitle, ey?</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4lfGwVD" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition</a> — A practical approach to understanding data structures and algorithms that focuses on real-world applications rather than academic theory.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/44B0dQE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#</a> — Excellent introduction to domain-driven design principles using functional programming concepts, applicable beyond F# to any language.</li>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4kBLTxA" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elm in Action</a> – This is The Book™ on Elm, by Richard Feldman (author of <a href="https://www.roc-lang.org" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Roc Programming language</a>). It&rsquo;s simply great. The last few chapters are a tiny bit overwhelming if you&rsquo;re new to Elm, but thankfully <a href="https://elm.land" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elm Land</a> solves much of that stuff for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://elm-lang.org/community" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elm Community</a> –Not a book at all, I know, but since this is my all time favorite programming community I can&rsquo;t help but mention it anyways.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4fruZyJ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Go Programming Language</a> —
Kind of obvious, this one. But a great classic! I remember enjoying the chapter about UTF-8 a lot, as well as the generally thorough explanations of how and <em>why</em> Golang behaves.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Bpf4TL" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concurrency in Go: Tools and Techniques for Developers</a> — This is a truly great programming book! Even though Golang is made for concurrency, it&rsquo;s still very possible to mess up. This book shows you how it&rsquo;s done. What&rsquo;s a bit cool (🤓) is that it predates the <code>context.Context</code> interface, and as such suggests using a manual &ldquo;done channel&rdquo; to enable canceling of coroutines. It shows the author&rsquo;s insight that an exact pattern like that was introduced with the <code>Context.Done()</code> method introduced later in the language. For more on that, check out <a href="https://github.com/cekrem/goutils/commit/0a511038efd9186cf204d503f7ff37c83b5c5838" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this git diff</a>, on a small golang utility library I started on way back.</li>
<li>Feel free to skip this one, though: <a href="https://amzn.to/3P1uq3R" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning Functional Programming in Go</a> — This book should, IMHO, rather have been a tweet. Something like this: &ldquo;Go is not really suited for functional programming, I&rsquo;d advice you not to do it at scale.&rdquo; Fun fact: this book is actually what got me into <a href="#kotlin" >Kotlin</a>. All that talk about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tail call optimization</a> (and how Golang is <em>not</em> doing that&hellip;) got me searching for more functional fun outside of Elm, Haskell and Lisp.</li>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Dyiyni" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming</a> — I read this one on my Kindle, actually, before I learned that Kindle&rsquo;s not where programming books really shine. That aside, I have nothing but fond memories from the first edition, and I&rsquo;ve heard the updates on the second edition are really worthwhile. If you want to read <em>one</em> Python book, this is it.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4gx5tt2" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition: Practical Programming for Total Beginners</a> — This one is also cool!

So, against my potential better judgment I let her stay home, but warned her that it wouldn&rsquo;t be quite a spa – some chores and a little school work was to be expected.

<p>In <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1" >part 1</a>, I made a small POC cli tool for doing multiple things in parallel. Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it. My adventures in part 2 have, however, been slightly shipwrecked.</p>]]></description>

<p>Most of us consider ReactJS a tool for rendering UI components on the web (or the DOM, specifically), and if by &ldquo;React&rdquo; we mean &ldquo;ReactDOM&rdquo; then we&rsquo;re right. But as we&rsquo;ve seen with React Native, React is not confined to the DOM at all, and can render to any number of environments. After all, like it says on the box, React is a &ldquo;JavaScript library for building user interfaces&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen the same with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compose Multiplatform</a>: what used to be a framework for creating Android UI can actually be used for so much more.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Day Has Come. I&rsquo;m officially archiving my previous <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan" >development plan</a> and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&rsquo;m happy to say that I&rsquo;ve achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I&rsquo;m ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I&rsquo;m not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet. So consider this post ceremonial more than anything.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: This plan is now archived. See <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era" >The End of an Era</a> for details.</strong></p>
<p>What follows is my own personal development plan as a software engineer at

expressions are a bit internal, as they will no doubt be for you as well on your own plan (should you find yourself
inspired to write one), but I&rsquo;ll leave it as is. Enjoy!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at <a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps MobilePay</a> since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &ldquo;Merchant Core&rdquo; team. I
created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (
let&rsquo;s not name those ever again&hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps
Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding. I&rsquo;ve hosted a Vipps Community Of
Practice plainly called &ldquo;Side Projects And Experiments&rdquo; (SPÆ) where I&rsquo;ve touched on quite a lot of exciting tech and
tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my &ldquo;real&rdquo; work has been with Golang and React. And
lot&rsquo;s(!) of complex SQL. <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company" >In mid 2020, I decided to expand my horizon and challenge myself by doing something completely
other</a>; I learned Kotlin during my summer holidays, and joined the
Android app to learn from Norway&rsquo;s best app
developers. So the Android team is where I&rsquo;m at now; the ~~

specifically.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Why I'm not using the Lightphone II (but my daughter is)</title>

 What&rsquo;s a Light Phone, and why are there two of them?

<p>The original Light Phone was a seriously dumb device. No texting, only phone calls. The company behind it never meant for it to be your only device, but a device to bring when you were &ldquo;going light&rdquo; – detaching yourself from all the digital clutter of your everyday (social media, feeds, notifications ++). It was a big a hit as one might expect, I guess, but quite a few people found the experience delightfully refreshing – but definitely not sustainable. After all, we need a few more bare essentials than just phone calls. Right?</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>So you&rsquo;ve been at your company for a couple of years. Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both? The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else. This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is <em>especially</em> true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to <em>say</em> that you&rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)</p>]]></description>

<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.dnb.vipps&amp;hl=no&amp;gl=US" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps App</a> – until recently – took about 45 minutes to build on <del>A$ure</del> Azure. With a weekly release schedule, that might not sound like a huge dealbreaker, but since we&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;feature branch&rdquo; approach to how we do <code>git</code> (ie no <code>develop</code> branch; <code>master</code> should always be deployable-ish), we don&rsquo;t allow merging <em>anything</em> to <code>master</code> without a successful cloud build. Waiting for code review is hard to avoid, but additionally waiting for slow builds is just wrong. It&rsquo;s not easy for our internal testers to check out what we&rsquo;re doing either, they <em>too</em> are kept waiting. Suffice to say, the pain has been real. Personally, coming from a Golang background (where builds happen at the speed of your monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate), this kind of wrecked my soul on a daily basis. Granted, Android builds are more complicated (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Java ecosystem!) than single-binary Golang builds, but 40+ minutes for one app build is too slow nonetheless.</p>]]></description>

      <title>React Advent Calendar – keto vegan, gluten free and no parabens or plastic wrapping</title>

<p>I grew up with a lot of creative advent calendars. The one type I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> get was the standard chocolate one that&rsquo;s most common these days. While I&rsquo;ve not consistently been very good at paying this forward, I do make an effort some years to do something a bit different for my wife. Yes, my wife; the kids get standard ones :P This year&rsquo;s plan was simple: create an online calendar with cozy favors, encouragements and the like each day until Christmas. I had planned to spend exactly one evening on this - the last evening of November, to be precise. But, my wife&rsquo;s plans for the evening evaporated as she decided she &ldquo;really wanted to hang out with me at home&rdquo; instead. Needless to say, I had to work quite fast.</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been tinkering a bit with Elm lately. The super-enforced functional and minimal paradigm is very refreshing, and serves as a sort of detox after spending one too many hour stuck in Android&rsquo;s not-so-lovely XML + mutating class world. Setting up a new bare minimum Elm app should be quite simple, but it turns out that there are a few more steps required than one would expect. My first instinct – being a React guy – was to try <code>yarn create elm-app</code> (or <code>npx create-elm-app</code>), hoping it would do the Elm-equivalent of what <code>create-react-app</code> does. Turns out, to my disappointment, that the end result leaves something to be desired. No proper live-reload out of the box, and a lot of the webpack stuff I was hoping to avoid completely with Elm. Yuck.</p>]]></description>
