      <title>Tailwind IntelliSense in Elm: A NeoVim Recipe</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re using Elm with Tailwind CSS in NeoVim, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that IntelliSense doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box. Here&rsquo;s a quick recipe to fix that.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">
 The Problem
 <a class="heading-link" href="#the-problem">
 <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
 <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
 </a>
</h2>
<p>Tailwind&rsquo;s LSP doesn&rsquo;t recognize Elm&rsquo;s syntax for CSS classes. When you write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff5c57">div</span> [ <span style="color:#ff5c57">class</span> <span style="color:#5af78e">&#34;bg-blue-500 text-white p-4&#34;</span> ] [ <span style="color:#ff5c57">text</span> <span style="color:#5af78e">&#34;Hello&#34;</span> ]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You get no autocomplete, no validation, and no hover documentation for your Tailwind classes.</p>]]></description>

      <title>The Craftsman Mindset: Lessons from Four Weeks Offline</title>
      <link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/craftsman-mindset/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I just returned from four weeks of vacation—no laptop, no programming books, and a phone that could barely do more than call and text. It’s the longest I’ve been away from code in years. I didn’t plan to make it a digital detox, but it turned out to be exactly what I needed. If you do get a chance to do the same, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it!</p>
<p>There’s something clarifying about stepping away from the things that usually fill your days. For me, that meant no late-night debugging, no “just one more chapter” of a programming book, and no side projects. Instead, I spent my sitting-down time reading more fiction, playing more Zelda, and generally letting my mind wander more than usual. It was good.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Programming as Theory Building: Why Senior Developers Are More Valuable Than Ever</title>
      <link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1985, computer scientist Peter Naur wrote a prescient essay called <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Programming as Theory Building&rdquo;</a> that feels more relevant today than ever. As we watch junior developers reflexively accept LLM-generated code they don&rsquo;t understand, and see codebases balloon with theoretically orphaned implementations, Naur&rsquo;s central thesis becomes crystal clear: <strong>a program is not its source code</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-theory-behind-the-code">
 The Theory Behind the Code

 <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
 <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
 </a>
</h2>
<p>Naur argues that programming is fundamentally about building a theory—a <strong>shared mental model</strong> of how a system works, why it works that way, and how it should evolve. The source code is merely a written representation of this theory, and like all representations, it&rsquo;s lossy. Critical knowledge about intent, design decisions, trade-offs, and the reasoning behind architectural choices exists only in the minds of the people who built the system.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes the best solution isn&rsquo;t the most elegant one. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the one that works, ships quickly, and solves the problem at hand. This is the story of how I built a search widget for my blog using what purists might call &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; – and why that was exactly the right choice.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I watched two very different developers encounter Claude Code for the first time. The contrast in their reactions perfectly captures the tension I&rsquo;ve been feeling about AI coding assistants lately.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claude Code</a> is Anthropic&rsquo;s AI-powered coding assistant that can read, write, and edit code across your entire codebase. Unlike traditional autocomplete tools, it can understand context across multiple files, execute commands, run tests, and even browse the web for documentation. Think of it as having an AI pair programmer that never gets tired and has read every Stack Overflow answer ever written.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s awesome to learn Elm by building a side project, you absolutely should. And maybe you have – perhaps you&rsquo;ve built a todo app, explored The Elm Architecture, and fallen in love with the reliability and maintainability that comes with functional programming and strong types.</p>
<p>But come Monday morning, you&rsquo;re back to wrestling with JavaScript bugs, runtime errors, and the nagging feeling that there has to be a better way. The problem isn&rsquo;t that Elm isn&rsquo;t ready for production work – it absolutely is. The problem is convincing your team, your boss, or your organization to take the leap. And when you&rsquo;re thinking about wholesale replacement, your boss&rsquo;s skepticism might be quite healthy. But here&rsquo;s the thing: if you reduce the scope, you can also reduce the risk and buy-in required. Instead of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s rebuild our entire app in Elm,&rdquo; what if the conversation was &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try Elm for this one small widget&rdquo;? Suddenly, the stakes drop dramatically.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s Friday, and I&rsquo;m up at 4am, wide awake, head filled with thoughts on recursive data structures and how to efficiently deal with them in our client&rsquo;s Elm application. I tried going back to sleep for a few minutes, but decided against it. My (Garmin) sleep score averages well above 90%, so I can deal with one slightly short night. <em>If I can just solve this puzzle</em>, it&rsquo;ll be more than worth it! I&rsquo;m doing test driven development on this particular problem. Not because I want to be fancy or make a point, but out of necessity – the complexity is far beyond what I would entrust myself without some guard rails while I iterate on it. <strong>It feels great</strong>, and I&rsquo;m already looking forward to the Sabbath moment when I can behold the work of my hands and see that it was good.</p>]]></description>

      <title>A Use Case for Port Boundaries in Frontend Development</title>
      <link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/a-case-for-port-boundaries-in-frontend/</link>

      <guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/a-case-for-port-boundaries-in-frontend/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the Elm ecosystem, the browser is treated like an I/O device. DOM events, JavaScript interop, and even network requests are kept outside the core logic. Rather than allowing side effects to permeate the codebase, Elm channels them through strictly typed boundaries known as <em>ports</em>.</p>
<p>This architectural stance is both radical and liberating. It allows you to build user interfaces where logic remains pure, testable, and robust, even as surrounding technologies evolve.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Dependency Inversion in React: Building Truly Testable Components</title>
      <link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/dependency-inversion-in-react/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of React development, we often find ourselves writing components that are tightly coupled to their dependencies. This makes testing difficult, maintenance a challenge, and change nearly impossible. The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) offers a way out of this mess, but how do we apply it effectively <strong>in React</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For a more backend-oriented take on Dependency Inversion, check out my previous post on <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/clean-architecture-and-plugins-in-go/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dependency Inversion in Go Using Plugins</a>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We all know we should write clean code. We&rsquo;ve read the books, attended the talks, and nodded along to the principles. Yet, somehow, we still find ourselves writing messy React components. Why is that? The answer lies not in our technical skills, but in our psychology.</p>

<p>When React applications start to slow down, <code>React.memo</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useCallback</code> are often the first tools developers reach for. After all, preventing unnecessary re-renders seems like a straightforward path to better performance. But in the React ecosystem, memoization is far more complex than it first appears.</p>
<p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at how these tools actually work under the hood, the subtle ways they can fail, and when they&rsquo;re truly beneficial versus when they&rsquo;re just adding unnecessary complexity.</p>]]></description>

<p>When dealing with large lists or complex DOM structures, performance optimization often feels like a complex puzzle. But sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most effective. Enter <code>content-visibility: auto</code> - a CSS property that can dramatically improve rendering performance with minimal effort.</p>
<p>You can (and IMHO should) read all about it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>! 🤓</p>

 </a>
</h2>
<p><code>content-visibility: auto</code> tells the browser to skip rendering elements that are not currently visible in the viewport. It&rsquo;s like having a virtual scroll implementation, but without the complexity of managing scroll positions or item heights manually.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common questions I get about Elm is: &ldquo;How do I integrate it with existing JavaScript ecosystems?&rdquo; While Elm&rsquo;s isolation is a strength, real-world projects often require working with external libraries, APIs, or UI components. Doing incremental migration is also the recommended way to introduce Elm, and luckily there are may ways to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll show you how to combine two powerful technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Elm Ports</strong>: The official way to communicate between Elm and JavaScript</li>
<li><strong>Web Components</strong>: Standard, framework-agnostic UI components</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination gives us the best of both worlds: Elm&rsquo;s type safety and predictable architecture alongside the reusability and interoperability of Web Components. Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>]]></description>

<p>When it comes to React performance optimization, <code>React.memo</code> is often the first tool developers reach for.

But what if I told you that in many cases, there are simpler, more elegant solutions that align better with React&rsquo;s compositional nature?</p>
<p>Today, I want to explore some fundamental concepts about how React renders components and share composition patterns that can dramatically improve performance without the complexity and gotchas of memoization.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a world dominated by React, Vue, and Svelte, it might seem strange to highlight Elm – a niche language that has existed since 2012 but has had fewer releases since then than React has in a year. But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.</p>]]></description>

<p>One of my responsibilities as an Android Developer in Vipps (Mobilepay) was to do tech interviews. After a while, I also made the tech assignments and changed the recruitment process a bit. But in the earlier days, we used a standard &ldquo;build X using Y&rdquo;, where &ldquo;Y&rdquo; was modern Android tools (preferably Compose), and &ldquo;X&rdquo; was some non-descript hello world-ish app that did something I can&rsquo;t for the life of me remember.

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4fruZyJ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Go Programming Language</a> —
Kind of obvious, this one. But a great classic! I remember enjoying the chapter about UTF-8 a lot, as well as the generally thorough explanations of how and <em>why</em> Golang behaves.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Bpf4TL" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concurrency in Go: Tools and Techniques for Developers</a> — This is a truly great programming book! Even though Golang is made for concurrency, it&rsquo;s still very possible to mess up. This book shows you how it&rsquo;s done. What&rsquo;s a bit cool (🤓) is that it predates the <code>context.Context</code> interface, and as such suggests using a manual &ldquo;done channel&rdquo; to enable canceling of coroutines. It shows the author&rsquo;s insight that an exact pattern like that was introduced with the <code>Context.Done()</code> method introduced later in the language. For more on that, check out <a href="https://github.com/cekrem/goutils/commit/0a511038efd9186cf204d503f7ff37c83b5c5838" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this git diff</a>, on a small golang utility library I started on way back.</li>
<li>Feel free to skip this one, though: <a href="https://amzn.to/3P1uq3R" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning Functional Programming in Go</a> — This book should, IMHO, rather have been a tweet. Something like this: &ldquo;Go is not really suited for functional programming, I&rsquo;d advice you not to do it at scale.&rdquo; Fun fact: this book is actually what got me into <a href="#kotlin" >Kotlin</a>.

<p>In <a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1" >part 1</a>, I made a small POC cli tool for doing multiple things in parallel. Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it. My adventures in part 2 have, however, been slightly shipwrecked.</p>]]></description>

<p>Most of us consider ReactJS a tool for rendering UI components on the web (or the DOM, specifically), and if by &ldquo;React&rdquo; we mean &ldquo;ReactDOM&rdquo; then we&rsquo;re right. But as we&rsquo;ve seen with React Native, React is not confined to the DOM at all, and can render to any number of environments. After all, like it says on the box, React is a &ldquo;JavaScript library for building user interfaces&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen the same with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compose Multiplatform</a>: what used to be a framework for creating Android UI can actually be used for so much more.</p>]]></description>

<p>The original Light Phone was a seriously dumb device. No texting, only phone calls. The company behind it never meant for it to be your only device, but a device to bring when you were &ldquo;going light&rdquo; – detaching yourself from all the digital clutter of your everyday (social media, feeds, notifications ++). It was a big a hit as one might expect, I guess, but quite a few people found the experience delightfully refreshing – but definitely not sustainable. After all, we need a few more bare essentials than just phone calls. Right?</p>]]></description>

Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both? The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else. This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is <em>especially</em> true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to <em>say</em> that you&rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)</p>]]></description>

<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.dnb.vipps&amp;hl=no&amp;gl=US" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps App</a> – until recently – took about 45 minutes to build on <del>A$ure</del> Azure. With a weekly release schedule, that might not sound like a huge dealbreaker, but since we&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;feature branch&rdquo; approach to how we do <code>git</code> (ie no <code>develop</code> branch; <code>master</code> should always be deployable-ish), we don&rsquo;t allow merging <em>anything</em> to <code>master</code> without a successful cloud build. Waiting for code review is hard to avoid, but additionally waiting for slow builds is just wrong. It&rsquo;s not easy for our internal testers to check out what we&rsquo;re doing either, they <em>too</em> are kept waiting. Suffice to say, the pain has been real. Personally, coming from a Golang background (where builds happen at the speed of your monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate), this kind of wrecked my soul on a daily basis. Granted, Android builds are more complicated (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Java ecosystem!) than single-binary Golang builds, but 40+ minutes for one app build is too slow nonetheless.</p>]]></description>

 TL;DR: I made an advent calendar in React, my wife loved it

<p>I grew up with a lot of creative advent calendars. The one type I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> get was the standard chocolate one that&rsquo;s most common these days. While I&rsquo;ve not consistently been very good at paying this forward, I do make an effort some years to do something a bit different for my wife. Yes, my wife; the kids get standard ones :P This year&rsquo;s plan was simple: create an online calendar with cozy favors, encouragements and the like each day until Christmas. I had planned to spend exactly one evening on this - the last evening of November, to be precise. But, my wife&rsquo;s plans for the evening evaporated as she decided she &ldquo;really wanted to hang out with me at home&rdquo; instead. Needless to say, I had to work quite fast.</p>]]></description>

      <title>create-elm-live-app – the smallest npm package ever?</title>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been tinkering a bit with Elm lately. The super-enforced functional and minimal paradigm is very refreshing, and serves as a sort of detox after spending one too many hour stuck in Android&rsquo;s not-so-lovely XML + mutating class world. Setting up a new bare minimum Elm app should be quite simple, but it turns out that there are a few more steps required than one would expect. My first instinct – being a React guy – was to try <code>yarn create elm-app</code> (or <code>npx create-elm-app</code>), hoping it would do the Elm-equivalent of what <code>create-react-app</code> does. Turns out, to my disappointment, that the end result leaves something to be desired. No proper live-reload out of the box, and a lot of the webpack stuff I was hoping to avoid completely with Elm. Yuck.</p>]]></description>
