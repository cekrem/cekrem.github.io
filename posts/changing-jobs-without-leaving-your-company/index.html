<a class=heading-link href=#restlessness-isnt-all-bad><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>After about two years @ Vipps, I honestly almost left. I had learned a lot from a lot of great people, and I had made some cool stuff that I&rsquo;m still quite proud of (and a few things that make me cringe a bit). But I&rsquo;m more of a pioneer than a maintainer, and my need for adventure kept rising, and it felt like I could do most of my day-to-day work half asleep. I missed the thrill of being in over my head, fighting to learn and fighting to work fast enough and good enough to keep up. At the time I was taking point on both recruiting and onboarding new Golang developers, and I also had gathered a few interesting programming books for both new and seasoned developers. As I skimmed through Lex Sheehan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Learning Functional Programming in Go&rdquo; (which – spoiler alert – basically tells you all the ways in which Golang is <em>not</em> suited for functional programming&mldr;), I somehow got caught up in the concept of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Tail-call</a> optimization. I did an unnerving amount of research and tried to find a sane, popular and useful programming language that <em>did</em> elegantly support this. I found Kotlin.</p><h1 id=lets-learn-something-new>Let&rsquo;s learn something new!
<a class=heading-link href=#lets-learn-something-new><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Before I knew it, I had applied for a position as an Android Developer. Where? @ Vipps. The thrill was back, but my friends were still nearby, as well as some of Norway&rsquo;s finest Android guys. I got to know new people, but we didn&rsquo;t start completely from scratch. I got to do something <em>other</em> and learn something completely new, but – and this is quite an interesting part – I was still treated like a senior developer. I had a track record at the company that gave me a head start I would have completely missed out on if I left. True, I could have taken on a position more similar to the one I had, but that would sort of defeat the purpose of changing jobs in the first place. When transferring within the company, it turned out, I could make an even <em>bigger</em> change. Trust was established, and we shared both history and values.</p><p>Changing jobs is always a gamble, and you can&rsquo;t always go back if you have second thoughts. I think this limits the amount of change and risk we&rsquo;re willing to take, and understandably so: the friction involved when breaking up with your company is not minor in any way, and if things go sour you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and a hard place. But I knew that I could <em>actually</em> go back, without the disgrace and discomfort usually involved. The whole job change was framed as a mutual experiment, which again enabled me to make a bigger leap than I would normally dare. How about that?</p><h1 id=so-how-did-it-go>So how did it go?
<a class=heading-link href=#so-how-did-it-go><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>I ended up not going back, and I think the switch has made me an overall better developer. There are definitely a few domain-specific things that one needs to learn from scratch, but at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re programmers, tech leads, architects, problem solvers, code reviewers and team players – regardless of platform and language. Not everything you learn will be directly transferable to other areas, but your overall understanding of tech, product and problem-solving will improve nonetheless. And, to be a bit technical it turns out my timing was awesome. Jetpack Compose is the new big thing in Android, and it&rsquo;s basically kind of React ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯. So long, RecyclerView and XML; our brief encounter was more than enough! Bonus perk: When I get bored and fed up with doing Android all day, I have quite a few opportunities to help out on projects that require skills from my pre-app developer era at Vipps, which I enjoy a lot more now than when that was all I did. Win-win!</p><h1 id=what-if-my-boss-says-no>What if my boss says no?
<a class=heading-link href=#what-if-my-boss-says-no><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><ul><li>Tell him/her to read this post and reconsider.</li><li>Ask &ldquo;what would this switch have to look like in two months to be
considered a success?&rdquo;, and commit to reaching those goals. Chances are they&rsquo;re more reasonable than you&rsquo;re afraid of.</li><li>Willingly submit yourself to be coached and evaluated regularly. What if you actually nail this?</li><li>Agree on a mutual escape clause. What if the grass wasn&rsquo;t greener on the other side after all? Or what if you didn&rsquo;t
quite have what it takes to succeed in that other area (yet)? If so you should have a
plan on how to celebrate finding it out in the safe context of a healthy experiment. (I assure you, this is still
cheaper than replacing you!)</li><li>Although this shouldn&rsquo;t be your opening line, the fact is: When push comes to shove it might boil down to whether or
not you make the switch within the company or leave the company.</li></ul><hr><p><img src=nope.gif alt=Nope.></p><p>️Notice the helmet ☝️</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2021 - 2024 Christian Ekrem
