<a class=heading-link href=#my-phone-is-not-dumb-enough><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been touching on the general topic of digital minimalism from time to time on this blog, not least in <a href=/posts/dumbing-down-my-iphone/>the post about dumbing down my iPhone and disabling its built-in browser</a>. I&rsquo;ve also <a href=/posts/why-im-not-using-the-lightphone-ii/>kind of reviewed the Lightphone II</a>, and found it to be a great idea not quite making the cut when the rubber hits the(/my) road. The struggle against screen addiction and digital death is real, and it takes a great deal of intentionality to keep my various smart devices on a leash, making sure I&rsquo;m the head and not the tail!</p><p>Here are some existing wins in the battle for my brain, heart and sleep</p><ul><li><strong>Spending time with Jesus before unlocking my phone in the morning</strong>: This is the most important one, as it kind of sets the course for the rest of the day.</li><li><strong>Removing all social media from my phone</strong>: Even Messenger and the like. It&rsquo;s a bit inconvenient at times, but IMHO really worth it.</li><li><strong>Checking email on Mondays (<em>only</em> Mondays)</strong>: This one is hard, and I&rsquo;ve failed miserably lately. But when it works, it&rsquo;s a bucketload of peace. I recommend it, even though I often miss the mark myself.</li><li><strong>Disabling Safari</strong>: Truly inconvenient, but all the more worth it. If I (think I) need to &ldquo;just check something&rdquo;, it&rsquo;ll have to wait until I&rsquo;m at my laptop, which I luckily don&rsquo;t bring everywhere.</li><li><strong>Using a grayscale filter</strong>: This supposedly decreases the dopamine rush of looking at the screen, at least, to me it serves as a gentle reminder that the real world is not found in OLED pixels.</li></ul><h2 id=the-problem-with-using-my-phone-to-solve-a-problem>The problem with using my phone to solve a problem
<a class=heading-link href=#the-problem-with-using-my-phone-to-solve-a-problem><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>A common denominator of all the above is that none of the things (checking texts in the morning, googling something on the go, replying to a group message etc) are &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in and of themselves. But whenever I <del>let the dragon out of its cage</del> unlock my iPhone, it demands more attention than I had initially budgeted on giving it. It&rsquo;s never &ldquo;just checking that email&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s checking that particular email and also being reminded about something completely unrelated that sets off a chain reaction of distractions (at the very least), or even worry, stress and low-level anxiety. And these things propagate and aggregate over time, so the baseline keeps adding up as the day runs along, leaving us less than peaceful when it&rsquo;s finally (and often quite suddenly!) time to sleep. Yikes.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want that. So whenever I can do something <em>without</em> unlocking my phone, I celebrate and implement. I&rsquo;ve long since stopped trying to find apps to solve problems, and rather look for things or ways to solve problems <em>without</em> apps.</p><h2 id=when-my-ram-runs-out>When my RAM runs out
<a class=heading-link href=#when-my-ram-runs-out><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I am a thinker, to some extent a planner, and in many ways a person in need of verbal or written processing. That is, I&rsquo;m most at ease when I can either discuss my ideas and/or concerns, or at the very least write them down for safekeeping. I&rsquo;ve previously argued that the best tool to take notes is the one close at hand, and I stand by that. When on my laptop I prefer <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/ripnote class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>ripnote</a>. But I&rsquo;ve found that I can (and must) be more intentional than just that; if I&rsquo;m already on my laptop, then <code>ripnote</code> is the best tool for the job – but I can choose whether to bring said laptop into a meeting, and it makes a difference whether I do or not. So, for quite some time I&rsquo;ve started rather bringing a paper notebook to meetings; it keeps distractions at arm&rsquo;s length, and makes it easier to stay focused and present (especially in boring meetings).</p><p>But when not being intentional, when simply walking around doing life, I&rsquo;ve up until now settled on taking notes using the tool already at hand—my iPhone. But I&rsquo;m all done with that too.</p><p>Apple Notes, Google Keep – whatever, it&rsquo;s all good. But again, it&rsquo;s never just &ldquo;jotting down that great idea for a new blog post&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s all the evil that lurks nearby, whether a reminder, a text that sounds urgent, or whatever notification you thought you&rsquo;d turned off that gets in your face. And the moment is gone before it even came. The best part of those weeks spent using a Lightphone was the feeling of being creative and present within my own thoughts. I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ve really missed it lately, and decided to try to keep note-taking at a safe distance from my phone as well.</p><h2 id=an-edc-extension>An <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>EDC</a> extension
<a class=heading-link href=#an-edc-extension><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>So, contrary to what I&rsquo;ve previously written—about just using whatever&rsquo;s close by, like <a href=/posts/ripnote/>ripnote</a>—<strong>I&rsquo;ve decided that for me it&rsquo;s worth always carrying a small notebook and a half-size pencil</strong>. When I have an idea, something I suddenly fear forgetting or something I want to process in writing, I now do that as well without reaching for my phone. To my own surprise, I found myself writing a small Elm application by hand the other day, while the kids were playing nearby. And I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;m actually quite fine with them seeing their dad caught up in his notes from time to time, inventing things or simply collecting his thoughts. I&rsquo;d much rather that than them seeing dad doomscrolling through life, distracted by this and that and never really present.</p><p><strong>Bad</strong>: Having an impulse to check whether Tom Bombadil actually put on the ring -> Googling it instantly
<strong>A little better</strong>: Putting it on a list of things to google later using whatever notetaking app
<strong>Much better</strong>: Writing it down without even <del>putting on the ring myself</del> unlocking my iPhone 🤤</p><p>So I&rsquo;m adding this to my existing battle plan: I&rsquo;m taking notes using a basic, nondescript black notebook and some random pencil one of my daughters forgot out in the yard.</p><p><img src=/images/edc.jpg alt="My notebook">
<em>(if you must know, it&rsquo;s a <a href=https://amzn.to/3VBByaB class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Moleskine Cahier</a> ruled notebook, but that&rsquo;s beside the point)</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m sure there are more dragons to slay, even ones that I&rsquo;m not aware of at all, but this new habit has already had a real effect on my sleep quality and creativity. I&rsquo;ve started one small and one huge side project since then, and I think it&rsquo;s closely related to freeing up mental and creative capacity. In summary, it&rsquo;s just like the others on the list: inconvenient, but worth it.</p><p>Our brains, hearts and sleep matter, so let&rsquo;s count the cost and act like it!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><style>form{display:flex;justify-content:center}</style><form action="https://api.follow.it/subscription-form/SDRVMUk2VmsySENBNk94RDNKNDFnS3NmWlQ5a3gxejNIeUlJWHl3QjdqNnRHdENkaXp5aXZhZlFvcGtzcEZ3K0o5TFVRdSt2WWM5RWRsWmZwWVhNUS9PZjJqMWZ3aHBwZUhjT1ZpWXBGRkdZOWtIcGhYQkJkSkE4QTQ1eHl5YkF8RTZHTExQOWFrN1pFY1F0RzZ5c3pVN2I1QTI1YXNtMjZiYllLU25zQkJ3bz0=/8" method=post><input type=email name=email required placeholder=Email spellcheck=false style="padding:1rem;border:none;border-radius:1rem 0 0 1rem;outline:none">
