&lt;p>When it comes to React performance optimization, &lt;code>React.memo&lt;/code> is often the first tool developers reach for. It&amp;rsquo;s the hammer we grab when we notice re-render issues, and suddenly everything looks like a nail. But what if I told you that in many cases, there are simpler, more elegant solutions that align better with React&amp;rsquo;s compositional nature?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I want to explore some fundamental concepts about how React renders components and share composition patterns that can dramatically improve performance without the complexity and gotchas of memoization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Hope I Get to Write a Lot of Elm Code in 2025</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a world dominated by React, Vue, and Svelte, it might seem strange to highlight Elm – a niche language that has existed since 2012 but has had fewer releases since then than React has in a year. But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refactoring Towards Cleaner Boundaries: Lessons from Building a Markdown Blog Engine (Part 3)</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/refactoring-towards-cleaner-boundaries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/refactoring-towards-cleaner-boundaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/replacing-hugo-with-kotlin-clean-architecture" >part 1&lt;/a>, we laid out our Clean Architecture vision.

&lt;p>One of my responsibilities as an Android Developer in Vipps (Mobilepay) was to do tech interviews. After a while, I also made the tech assignments and changed the recruitment process a bit. But in the earlier days, we used a standard &amp;ldquo;build X using Y&amp;rdquo;, where &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; was modern Android tools (preferably Compose), and &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; was some non-descript hello world-ish app that did something I can&amp;rsquo;t for the life of me remember.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve lately enjoyed revisiting the &lt;a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLID Design Principles&lt;/a>. In the world of software architecture, few principles have stood the test of time like these. I find the &amp;ldquo;Dependency Inversion Principle&amp;rdquo; particularly interesting, as it&amp;rsquo;s one of the few that are either forgotten in modern applications, or drowned in so much over-engineering that the cost/benefit equation is offset anyways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Books I Think Software Engineers Should Read</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/books-i-think-software-engineers-should-read/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/books-i-think-software-engineers-should-read/</guid><description>&lt;p>What follows is a non-ordered &amp;amp; non-exhaustive list of great programming books that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend every ambitious software engineer.

&lt;p>Disclaimer: I have not read all of these from cover to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ve read most, but some are on my list of books to read next based on suggestions and/or reviews from people I trust.&lt;/p>

If you read one book on this list, go for this one, for real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3VIleoE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ZZu3Ny" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code&lt;em>r&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4iAc8o1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Architecture&lt;/a> — These Uncle Bob classics are great. I&amp;rsquo;m currently enjoying the architecture one &lt;em>on audible&lt;/em>, that&amp;rsquo;s a first for me with a software engineering book. Simply great, and truly a pleasant read/listen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gjf4Ud" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery&lt;/a> — A classic, and a good one at that!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/41GYOrQ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track&lt;/a> — This one I find a tiny bit boring, to be perfectly honest, but still very helpful. Lot&amp;rsquo;s of insight about &amp;ldquo;all the other stuff&amp;rdquo; (not coding).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gjc9ex" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact&lt;/a> — I haven&amp;rsquo;t read this one yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s been highly recommended to me by trustworthy people.

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4fruZyJ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Go Programming Language&lt;/a> —
Kind of obvious, this one. But a great classic! I remember enjoying the chapter about UTF-8 a lot, as well as the generally thorough explanations of how and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> Golang behaves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Bpf4TL" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concurrency in Go: Tools and Techniques for Developers&lt;/a> — This is a truly great programming book! Even though Golang is made for concurrency, it&amp;rsquo;s still very possible to mess up. This book shows you how it&amp;rsquo;s done. What&amp;rsquo;s a bit cool (🤓) is that it predates the &lt;code>context.Context&lt;/code> interface, and as such suggests using a manual &amp;ldquo;done channel&amp;rdquo; to enable canceling of coroutines. It shows the author&amp;rsquo;s insight that an exact pattern like that was introduced with the &lt;code>Context.Done()&lt;/code> method introduced later in the language. For more on that, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/cekrem/goutils/commit/0a511038efd9186cf204d503f7ff37c83b5c5838" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this git diff&lt;/a>, on a small golang utility library I started on way back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feel free to skip this one, though: &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3P1uq3R" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning Functional Programming in Go&lt;/a> — This book should, IMHO, rather have been a tweet. Something like this: &amp;ldquo;Go is not really suited for functional programming, I&amp;rsquo;d advice you not to do it at scale.&amp;rdquo; Fun fact: this book is actually what got me into &lt;a href="#kotlin" >Kotlin&lt;/a>. All that talk about &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tail call optimization&lt;/a> (and how Golang is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> doing that&amp;hellip;) got me searching for more functional fun outside of Elm, Haskell and Lisp.&lt;/li>

Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it.

&lt;p>Most of us consider ReactJS a tool for rendering UI components on the web (or the DOM, specifically), and if by &amp;ldquo;React&amp;rdquo; we mean &amp;ldquo;ReactDOM&amp;rdquo; then we&amp;rsquo;re right. But as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with React Native, React is not confined to the DOM at all, and can render to any number of environments. After all, like it says on the box, React is a &amp;ldquo;JavaScript library for building user interfaces&amp;rdquo;. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same with &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compose Multiplatform&lt;/a>: what used to be a framework for creating Android UI can actually be used for so much more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The End of an Era!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/back-to-the-old-gym" >Here&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s the next development plan, kind of.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (
let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps

tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work has been with Golang and React. And

&lt;p>The original Light Phone was a seriously dumb device. No texting, only phone calls. The company behind it never meant for it to be your only device, but a device to bring when you were &amp;ldquo;going light&amp;rdquo; – detaching yourself from all the digital clutter of your everyday (social media, feeds, notifications ++). It was a big a hit as one might expect, I guess, but quite a few people found the experience delightfully refreshing – but definitely not sustainable. After all, we need a few more bare essentials than just phone calls.

With a weekly release schedule, that might not sound like a huge dealbreaker, but since we&amp;rsquo;re using a &amp;ldquo;feature branch&amp;rdquo; approach to how we do &lt;code>git&lt;/code> (ie no &lt;code>develop&lt;/code> branch; &lt;code>master&lt;/code> should always be deployable-ish), we don&amp;rsquo;t allow merging &lt;em>anything&lt;/em> to &lt;code>master&lt;/code> without a successful cloud build. Waiting for code review is hard to avoid, but additionally waiting for slow builds is just wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy for our internal testers to check out what we&amp;rsquo;re doing either, they &lt;em>too&lt;/em> are kept waiting. Suffice to say, the pain has been real. Personally, coming from a Golang background (where builds happen at the speed of your monitor&amp;rsquo;s refresh rate), this kind of wrecked my soul on a daily basis. Granted, Android builds are more complicated (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, Java ecosystem!) than single-binary Golang builds, but 40+ minutes for one app build is too slow nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>React Advent Calendar – keto vegan, gluten free and no parabens or plastic wrapping</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/react-advent-calendar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/react-advent-calendar/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="tldr-i-made-an-advent-calendar-in-react-my-wife-loved-it">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering a bit with Elm lately. The super-enforced functional and minimal paradigm is very refreshing, and serves as a sort of detox after spending one too many hour stuck in Android&amp;rsquo;s not-so-lovely XML + mutating class world. Setting up a new bare minimum Elm app should be quite simple, but it turns out that there are a few more steps required than one would expect. My first instinct – being a React guy – was to try &lt;code>yarn create elm-app&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>npx create-elm-app&lt;/code>), hoping it would do the Elm-equivalent of what &lt;code>create-react-app&lt;/code> does. Turns out, to my disappointment, that the end result leaves something to be desired. No proper live-reload out of the box, and a lot of the webpack stuff I was hoping to avoid completely with Elm.
