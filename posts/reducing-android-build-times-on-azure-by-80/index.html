The Vipps App – until recently – took about 45 minutes to build on A$ure Azure. With a weekly release schedule, that might not sound like a huge dealbreaker, but since we&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;feature branch&rdquo; approach to how we do git (ie no develop branch; master should always be deployable-ish), we don&rsquo;t allow merging anything to master without a successful cloud build. Waiting for code review is hard to avoid, but additionally waiting for slow builds is just wrong. It&rsquo;s not easy for our internal testers to check out what we&rsquo;re doing either, they too are kept waiting. Suffice to say, the pain has been real. Personally, coming from a Golang background (where builds happen at the speed of your monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate), this kind of wrecked my soul on a daily basis. Granted, Android builds are more complicated (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Java ecosystem!) than single-binary Golang builds, but 40+ minutes for one app build is too slow nonetheless."><meta name=keywords content="developer,personal"><meta name=fediverse:creator content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://cekrem.github.io/images/featured-with-margins.png"><meta name=twitter:title content="Reducing Android Build Times on Azure by 80% using a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)"><meta name=twitter:description content="A VMSS is, put as plainly as possible, a cluster of VMs that are scaled on-demand or manually.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>TL;DR: The M1 chip:</p><p><img src=m1-build.png alt="local m1 build"></p><p>I think we&rsquo;ve grown a bit accustomed to builds just being slow. Even locally on quite high-end hardware, we usually passed the 10-minute mark. But when we started using M1 MacBook pro&rsquo;s, we were once again reminded that builds don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to be slow, and the huge difference between local and cloud builds was once again very apparent. Initially I was hoping Azure might support macOS agents running on M1 hardware (which I&rsquo;m sure they will eventually), but even without that I had to try <em>something</em>.</p><h2 id=a-virtual-machine-what-now>A Virtual machine what-now?

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>We run most our Vipps builds on generic &ldquo;Hosted agents&rdquo;, either running Ubuntu LTS or macOS. These agents come off the shelf pre-configured and pre-provisioned, with just about everything you need and then some. And, apparently, they&rsquo;re a lot slower than setting up your own stuff. One alternative is utilizing a <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Virtual Machine Scale Set</em> (VMSS)</a>. This &ldquo;Scale Set&rdquo; is still hosted on Azure, but we&rsquo;re suddenly responsible for config and provisioning of the agents. A VMSS is, put as plainly as possible, a cluster of VMs that are scaled on-demand or manually. Our lead Android architect brought this option to my attention and suggested giving it a shot. Should be easy, right?</p><h2 id=here-be-dragons-or--what-sounds-like-a-breeze-but-really-isnt-in-azure-land>Here be dragons, or – What sounds like a breeze, but really isn&rsquo;t in Azure land

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>A lesson learned early in Azure dealings is that <strong>disks are usually the bottleneck of everything</strong>. On VMSSs you have 4 options</p><ul><li>Standard HDD: unthinkably slow</li><li>Premium SSD: still way too slow, and I suspect the main reason generic hosted agents are so slow</li><li><a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Ephemeral HDD</a> as &ldquo;temp/resource disk&rdquo;: faster, but not by any means fast</li><li>Ephemeral HDD as &ldquo;OS cache disk&rdquo;: as fast as it gets on Azure, which is not very fast but not ridiculously slow either. <strong>This is what you want!</strong></li></ul><p>An ephemeral disk is an actual disk physically mounted on the same hardware as the VM, which makes it a lot faster than any other disk accessed remotely. It&rsquo;s not entirely clear to me what the <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>placement of the ephemeral disk</a> actually means, but there&rsquo;s a huge performance difference. I&rsquo;m not sure why one would ever choose temp/resource over OS cache ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p><p>The next step is to find a VM that actually <em>supports</em> the &ldquo;right&rdquo; ephemeral placement, and after some vigorous trial and error we decided on the <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ddv4-ddsv4-series class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Standard_D16ds_v4</a>. It turns out 16 cores and 64GiB RAM is all you need for Azure to build something about 5 times slower than your laptop :D</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-env data-lang=env><span style=display:flex><span><span style=font-style:italic># Insane RAM usage?

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>After creating your scale set, you have to connect it to your build pipeline. You can try to do this from the Azure portal or the <code>az</code> CLI, but I think it&rsquo;s actually impossible. The &ldquo;right&rdquo; way is to register a new Build Agent from DevOps.</p><p><img src=add-agent-pool.png alt="Add agent pool from Azure DevOps"></p><h4 id=finding-out-which-permissions-you-need-to-make-said-connection>Finding out which permissions you need to make said connection

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>Well, not <code>unzip</code>, for starters.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>The main gotcha here (besides not using Ubuntu 20) is that Azure has their own azurized <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> that works about 30% of the time. Be sure to fix that in your provisioning script!</p><h4 id=provisioning-your-vms-with-what-you-need-to-avoid-downloading-java-android-sdk--for-each-build>Provisioning your VMs with what you need (to avoid downloading Java, Android SDK ++ for each build)

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>There are whispers and rumors of <a href=https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>cloudinit</a> and a few other approaches, but in practice you&rsquo;re pretty much running blind going most routes. No logging, no feedback, no sense of &ldquo;did this run or not?&rdquo;. Adding a custom script extension kind of works, though. In order to load it from an external location and not an unstable azure blob, you need to add it using <code>az</code>, not the portal:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>az vmss extension set -g [resource-group] --vmss-name [vmss-name] --name customScript --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions --protected-settings &#39;{&#34;fileUris&#34;:[&#34;https://example.com/setup.sh&#34;],&#34;commmand&#34;: &#34;bash setup.sh&#34; }&#39;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>BUT, don&rsquo;t ever try to just change that script, or even change the script and re-run the above command. You risk Azure caching <em>half the script</em>(!!!) and essentially running half of the old and half of the new version. So be sure to change file name on each iteration. I&rsquo;m serious.</p><p>Our <code>setup.sh</code> looks like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span><span>#!/bin/bash
