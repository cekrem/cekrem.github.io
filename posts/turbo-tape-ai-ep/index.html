<a class=heading-link href=#turbo-tape---bit-blaster-ep><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>OK, so here goes: an entire EP without a single track of audio that I recorded myself. What&rsquo;s more, I didn&rsquo;t even connect my MIDI keyboard! You can stream it on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7t1lijjr9lKB3ilVaGhmVM?si=3NynQ5RGRdeSxzchWTTLdQ">Spotify</a>, <a href=https://music.apple.com/us/album/bit-blaster-ep/1750032737>Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sz9yWBFBFM&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mFUUQk8_HeMGOJiZWwj1SebgNTCdqUrV0&amp;index=1">YouTube</a> and probably everywhere else music is streamed. What invention describes the confusing mix of analog and digital means of conveying both data and audio than the <a href=https://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue57/turbotape.html>Turbo Tape</a>?</p><p>AI album art looks nice, huh?</p><p><img src=bitblaster.png alt="&ldquo;Bit Blaster - EP&rdquo;"></p><h2 id=how-why-and-how-dare-you>&ldquo;How&rdquo;, &ldquo;why&rdquo;, and &ldquo;how dare you&rdquo;?
<a class=heading-link href=#how-why-and-how-dare-you><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>For now, I&rsquo;ll keep my cards close to the chest regarding the specifics of the &ldquo;how&rdquo;, but suffice to say we&rsquo;re talking generative AI models capable of text-to- well, music. As for &ldquo;why&rdquo;, I was mainly curious. Very curious. I&rsquo;m actually trying to limit my own usage of AI assistance quite heavily. Sure I use some auto-complete (and friends) for my everyday coding tasks, but I often turn it all off I&rsquo;m solving something complicated or feeling particularly creative. After all, what&rsquo;s the joy of flying if the auto pilot is always on? I&rsquo;m also not buying in to the whole &ldquo;AI is here to stay, it&rsquo;s not a matter of <em>if</em> but <em>how</em> we use it&rdquo; mentality either – there are numerous areas of my life I don&rsquo;t want suggestions, opinions or hotfixes from an AI. And I thought music would be one of them, for sure.</p><p>Not surprisingly, I approached this experiment with more than a little skepticism; after all, few things in life are as &ldquo;real&rdquo; to me, as close to the heart and Human (as Human was intended, that is) as music. But I was blown away in the midst of it by how close to home/heart some of the tunes turned out. Granted, this EP is within quite specific bounds with regards to genre and references, but still. Some parts sound just &ldquo;good&rdquo; in general, but others are approaching half-forgotten memories and even dreams. That&rsquo;s when stuff gets weird. And interesting. My wife even told me that &ldquo;this really sounds like your style&rdquo;! For the record, I&rsquo;m mostly a live musician myself, and I very rarely listen to electronic music at all. But when I do, I&rsquo;d like it to sound like Turbo Tape. And it feels like my music, in many ways.</p><h2 id=in-summary>In summary?
<a class=heading-link href=#in-summary><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>I was expecting soul-less, brain dead, repetitive, genre-specific muzak (and you&rsquo;re welcome to conclude that&rsquo;s what I made!), but somehow found that at least a little bit of myself survived the text -> music translation. At list I&rsquo;m clinging to that. I don&rsquo;t like the idea that the AI made something beautiful &ldquo;by itself&rdquo;, as it were. Because that would mean that my contribution made no difference. Did it?</p><p>The potentially super sad part if this way of making music actually works is all the countless hours I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> spend making this. It&rsquo;s more than a little unfair, if my record outperforms something made by hand. Again, the instrumental retro game soundtrack landscape is probably one of the easier ones to enter using this approach; I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to release acoustic jazz with the same workflow. But I&rsquo;m still conflicted when facing the implications this could have.</p><p>That said, I find myself wanting to make &ldquo;real&rdquo; remixes of this EP. Splitting into stems, and replacing tracks with real recordings. Will it then be real music?</p><p>I&rsquo;m confused.</p><p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Press play on tape, I guess.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2021 - 2024 Christian Ekrem
