Having worked with him in two different teams and companies now, one of the decidedly most impressive aspect about him is how extremely quickly and easily he picks up new technologies. At both places his competence, ability to work independently, great humour, spirit, and team-player skills made him the backbone and go-to person in the team. Without a doubt a rare catch for any team, and I expect to see him in a leading tech role in the near future ðŸ˜‰",
