I created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (let's not name those ever again…), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding. I've hosted a Vipps Community Of Practice plainly called "Side Projects And Experiments" (SPÆ) where I've touched on quite a lot of exciting tech and tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my "real" work has been with Golang and React. And lot's(!) of complex SQL. In mid 2020, I decided to expand my horizon and challenge myself by doing something completely other; I learned Kotlin during my summer holidays, and joined the Android app to learn from Norway's best app developers. So the Android team is where I'm at now; the eCom and Vipps Login sub team more specifically.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>What do I want to be doing that I'm not doing now?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>On my previous team, I had a reputation for getting stuff done and delivering value efficiently. I also did quite a bit of mentoring and had a few internal talks on Golang development, and did the occational "Show and Tell" on frontend stuff. I want to grow into being able to do the same on my new team, where I'm less technically experienced (Android development) and have less domain knowledge (eCom and apps in general). As an Android developer, I would like to obtain the same skill level and expertice that I currently have in Golang and React. I want to keep being an empowering mentor in the new team as well, and bring value to the company both through mentoring/sponsoring and actual code. I'd like to, in time, become the CPS – Chief Problem Solver – on all tings Android/eCom specific, and provide meaningful insight from my combined backend and app development experience.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>Hall of Fame</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><table><thead><tr><th>Achievement</th><th>Notes</th><th>Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Created proper development plan</td><td>I've put this off for a while, so finishing it before summer vacation feels <span style=text-decoration:underline>great</span>!</td><td>2021-07-07</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-4>Short-term goals (before parental leave '21)</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-2><table><thead><tr><th>Goal</th><th>Next steps</th><th>Success measures</th><th>Support needed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Create a habit of intentionally practicing hard deep-focus programming tasks</td><td>Do August challenge on Codility after summer vacation</td><td>Complete all monthly challenges on Codility starting August '21, earn "Gold" on at least one out of three</td><td>A predictable schedule is needed for this and other deep work tasks (i.e. same day meetings kept to a minimum)</td></tr><tr><td>Become the go-to person for all things "Vipps Login" on Android</td><td>Do a thorough refactoring and cleanup (together with Max) after v2 login endpoints are in place</td><td>When something needs fixing related to Vipps Login, "ask @cekrem" is a viable response (and I'm actually able to fix it)</td><td>Time to actually dig into the login code and do (sorely needed) refactoring</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-5>Mid-term goals (before summer '22)</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-2><table><thead><tr><th>Goal</th><th>Next steps</th><th>Success measures</th><th>Support needed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Make sure everyone on my team is familiar and confident with all things "Vipps Login" on Android</td><td>Schedule knowledge session after v2 refactoring</td><td>Everyone in the team feels confident working on the "Vipps Login" part of our code base</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Become the go-to person for all things eCom on Android</td><td>TBA</td><td>When something needs fixing related to eCom, "ask @cekrem" is a viable response (and I'm actually able to fix it)</td><td>Time and help understanding the various eCom payment flows</td></tr><tr><td>Become a regular Open Source contributor</td><td>Decide which project(s) to contribute to</td><td>Contribute monthly to at least one open source project with 100+ stars</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-6>Long-term goals (Christmas '23)</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-2><table><thead><tr><th>Goal</th><th>Next steps</th><th>Success measures</th><th>Support needed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Become a Level 4 Engineer at Vipps ("staff engineer")</td><td>Start writing regularly for Vipps @ Medium?</td><td>"Alf-Thomas says so"?</td><td>I need help defining more concrete goals and growth areas</td></tr><tr><td>Become the go-to guy for all things JetPack Compose</td><td>TBA</td><td>Hosting a Compose workshop?</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
