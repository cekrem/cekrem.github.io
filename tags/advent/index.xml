 TL;DR: I made an advent calendar in React, my wife loved it
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#tldr-i-made-an-advent-calendar-in-react-my-wife-loved-it">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I grew up with a lot of creative advent calendars. The one type I &lt;em>didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> get was the standard chocolate one that&amp;rsquo;s most common these days. While I&amp;rsquo;ve not consistently been very good at paying this forward, I do make an effort some years to do something a bit different for my wife. Yes, my wife; the kids get standard ones :P This year&amp;rsquo;s plan was simple: create an online calendar with cozy favors, encouragements and the like each day until Christmas. I had planned to spend exactly one evening on this - the last evening of November, to be precise. But, my wife&amp;rsquo;s plans for the evening evaporated as she decided she &amp;ldquo;really wanted to hang out with me at home&amp;rdquo; instead. Needless to say, I had to work quite fast.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
