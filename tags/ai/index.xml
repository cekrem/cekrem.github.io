When those people leave (or never understood it in the first place), the theory dies, and you&amp;rsquo;re left with a codebase that works but nobody truly comprehends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this more, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe the problem goes deeper than individual developers losing their edge. Yes, people are losing the ability to build theories. But the &lt;em&gt;institutions&lt;/em&gt; where theory-building happens are being degraded too. Our teams, our companies, our profession. The whole ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I'm taking a three-week LLM fast!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/im-taking-a-three-week-llm-fast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/im-taking-a-three-week-llm-fast/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="im-not-that-addicted-am-i"&gt;
 I&amp;rsquo;m not that addicted. Am I?

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use agents for coding. &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym" &gt;I love my craft far too much&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;ve of course tried it. But every time I felt the worse for it afterwards, learned less than nothing, and &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/" &gt;ended up with code I neither owned or understood completely&lt;/a&gt;. Yuck. Nevertheless, LLMs have been sneaking into various workflows without my being completely intentional about it. My mantra has been to use it like Python scripts, &amp;ldquo;to automate (or simplify/streamline) the boring parts&amp;rdquo; while keeping it at arms length from everything I truly care about. But &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; is a woolly and dynamic term, and I find myself growing lazy in more ways than I&amp;rsquo;d planned, as well as more easily bored. I suspect my brain is shutting down various faculties whenever I don&amp;rsquo;t bother finishing a sentence in my notes, summarizing longer parts of text or wraiting slopppy because some LLM will proof read things afterwards anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like when Frodo slips on his ring to get out of a tough spot. It seems to solve an immediate problem quite efficiently, but every time Sauron closes in (and it&amp;rsquo;s actually &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; worth it).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Programming as Theory Building: Why Senior Developers Are More Valuable Than Ever</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I&amp;rsquo;ve written a follow-up exploring how AI degrades the institutions where theory-building happens: &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-part-ii/" &gt;Part II: When Institutions Crumble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, computer scientist Peter Naur wrote a prescient essay called &lt;a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Programming as Theory Building&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that feels more relevant today than ever. As we watch junior developers reflexively accept LLM-generated code they don&amp;rsquo;t understand, and see codebases balloon with theoretically orphaned implementations, Naur&amp;rsquo;s central thesis becomes crystal clear: &lt;strong&gt;a program is not its source code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Claude Code: Game Changer or Just Hype?</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/claude-code-game-changer-or-just-hype/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/claude-code-game-changer-or-just-hype/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I watched two very different developers encounter Claude Code for the first time. The contrast in their reactions perfectly captures the tension I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling about AI coding assistants lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s AI-powered coding assistant that can read, write, and edit code across your entire codebase. Unlike traditional autocomplete tools, it can understand context across multiple files, execute commands, run tests, and even browse the web for documentation. Think of it as having an AI pair programmer that never gets tired and has read every Stack Overflow answer ever written.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Coding as Craft: Going Back to the Old Gym</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://x.com/tobi/status/1909231499448401946" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Shopify&amp;rsquo;s CEO Tobi Lütke shared his thoughts on AI&amp;rsquo;s role in coding&lt;/a&gt;, stating that &amp;ldquo;reflexive AI usage is now a baseline expectation at Shopify.&amp;rdquo; The gist of his message was that AI is revolutionizing how we work, and everybody should jump on board this train or risk being left behind. I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing a bit, but not much – check out the post for complete context and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This struck a chord with me, but not in the way he intended. In a Slack conversation with fellow Elm engineers, I found myself typing:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Math test for staying home with semi-sick kids</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/math-test-for-home-schooling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 13:35:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/math-test-for-home-schooling/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sick-kid-but-not-that-sick"&gt;
 Sick kid, but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; sick?

 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I was home with my oldest daughter. She had a slight cold and an Almost-Fever™, which is usually not enough to skip school by my standards, but this particular day was an outdoors day with a lot of straining physical activity. So, against my potential better judgment I let her stay home, but warned her that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be quite a spa – some chores and a little school work was to be expected. She gladly accepted my terms, well-raised and polite as she indeed is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I released an EP without recording a single track.

 Turbo Tape - Bit Blaster (EP)

 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so here goes: an entire EP without a single track of audio that I recorded myself. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even connect my MIDI keyboard! You can stream it on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7t1lijjr9lKB3ilVaGhmVM?si=3NynQ5RGRdeSxzchWTTLdQ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/bit-blaster-ep/1750032737" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sz9yWBFBFM&amp;amp;list=OLAK5uy_mFUUQk8_HeMGOJiZWwj1SebgNTCdqUrV0&amp;amp;index=1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and probably everywhere else music is streamed.
