I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing a bit, but not much – check out the post for complete context and content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This struck a chord with me, but not in the way he intended. In a Slack conversation with fellow Elm engineers, I found myself typing:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Math test for staying home with semi-sick kids</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/math-test-for-home-schooling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 13:35:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/math-test-for-home-schooling/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sick-kid-but-not-that-sick">Sick kid, but not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> sick?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The other day I was home with my oldest daughter. She had a slight cold and an Almost-Fever™, which is usually not enough to skip school by my standards, but this particular day was an outdoors day with a lot of straining physical activity. So, against my potential better judgment I let her stay home, but warned her that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be quite a spa – some chores and a little school work was to be expected. She gladly accepted my terms, well-raised and polite as she indeed is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I released an EP without recording a single track. No loops or midi either.</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/turbo-tape-ai-ep/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 08:15:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/turbo-tape-ai-ep/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="turbo-tape---bit-blaster-ep">Turbo Tape - Bit Blaster (EP)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OK, so here goes: an entire EP without a single track of audio that I recorded myself. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even connect my MIDI keyboard! You can stream it on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7t1lijjr9lKB3ilVaGhmVM?si=3NynQ5RGRdeSxzchWTTLdQ">Spotify&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/bit-blaster-ep/1750032737">Apple Music&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sz9yWBFBFM&amp;amp;list=OLAK5uy_mFUUQk8_HeMGOJiZWwj1SebgNTCdqUrV0&amp;amp;index=1">YouTube&lt;/a> and probably everywhere else music is streamed. What invention describes the confusing mix of analog and digital means of conveying both data and audio than the &lt;a href="https://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue57/turbotape.html">Turbo Tape&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AI album art looks nice, huh?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
