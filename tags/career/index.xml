The language specific ones are obviously not for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disclaimer: I have not read all of these from cover to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ve read most, but some are on my list of books to read next based on suggestions and/or reviews from people I trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="general">
 General
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#general">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gAOaHa" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World&lt;/a> – Not a programming / software engineering book at all per say, but a &lt;em>highly&lt;/em> recommended read regardless. If you read one book on this list, go for this one, for real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3VIleoE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ZZu3Ny" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code&lt;em>r&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4iAc8o1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Architecture&lt;/a> — These Uncle Bob classics are great. I&amp;rsquo;m currently enjoying the architecture one &lt;em>on audible&lt;/em>, that&amp;rsquo;s a first for me with a software engineering book. Simply great, and truly a pleasant read/listen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gjf4Ud" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery&lt;/a> — A classic, and a good one at that!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/41GYOrQ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track&lt;/a> — This one I find a tiny bit boring, to be perfectly honest, but still very helpful. Lot&amp;rsquo;s of insight about &amp;ldquo;all the other stuff&amp;rdquo; (not coding).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gjc9ex" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact&lt;/a> — I haven&amp;rsquo;t read this one yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s been highly recommended to me by trustworthy people. And how about that killer subtitle, ey?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="golang">
 Golang
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#golang">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4fruZyJ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Go Programming Language&lt;/a> —
Kind of obvious, this one. But a great classic! I remember enjoying the chapter about UTF-8 a lot, as well as the generally thorough explanations of how and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> Golang behaves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Bpf4TL" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concurrency in Go: Tools and Techniques for Developers&lt;/a> — This is a truly great programming book! Even though Golang is made for concurrency, it&amp;rsquo;s still very possible to mess up. This book shows you how it&amp;rsquo;s done. What&amp;rsquo;s a bit cool (🤓) is that it predates the &lt;code>context.Context&lt;/code> interface, and as such suggests using a manual &amp;ldquo;done channel&amp;rdquo; to enable canceling of coroutines. It shows the author&amp;rsquo;s insight that an exact pattern like that was introduced with the &lt;code>Context.Done()&lt;/code> method introduced later in the language. For more on that, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/cekrem/goutils/commit/0a511038efd9186cf204d503f7ff37c83b5c5838" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this git diff&lt;/a>, on a small golang utility library I started on way back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feel free to skip this one, though: &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3P1uq3R" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning Functional Programming in Go&lt;/a> — This book should, IMHO, rather have been a tweet. Something like this: &amp;ldquo;Go is not really suited for functional programming, I&amp;rsquo;d advice you not to do it at scale.&amp;rdquo; Fun fact: this book is actually what got me into &lt;a href="#kotlin" >Kotlin&lt;/a>. All that talk about &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tail call optimization&lt;/a> (and how Golang is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> doing that&amp;hellip;) got me searching for more functional fun outside of Elm, Haskell and Lisp.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="python">
 Python
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#python">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Dyiyni" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming&lt;/a> — I read this one on my Kindle, actually, before I learned that Kindle&amp;rsquo;s not where programming books really shine. That aside, I have nothing but fond memories from the first edition, and I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the updates on the second edition are really worthwhile. If you want to read &lt;em>one&lt;/em> Python book, this is it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gx5tt2" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition: Practical Programming for Total Beginners&lt;/a> — This one is also cool! While mainly targeting &amp;ldquo;total beginners&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s also suitable for seasoned programmers who don&amp;rsquo;t usually work in Python, but want to leverage its super fast scripting capabilities to automate stuff.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="kotlin">
 Kotlin
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#kotlin">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gjT1wU" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Functional Programming in Kotlin&lt;/a> — Functional Programming &lt;em>and&lt;/em> Kotlin in the same book title?! No-brainer. This one is great!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/402VYev" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlin in Action&lt;/a> — One of two &amp;ldquo;general Kotlin books&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d recommend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ZYEdxN" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastering Kotlin&lt;/a> — The other one :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="lisp">
 Lisp
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#lisp">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4izuO7c" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land of Lisp: Learn to Program in Lisp, One Game at a Time!&lt;/a> — A bit whimsical, but then again Lisp is &lt;em>not&lt;/em>, so in sum a semi-serious book. I liked it ¯\&lt;em>(ツ)&lt;/em>/¯&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4gf8sq2" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Lisp: Advanced Techniques for Common Lisp&lt;/a> — &lt;em>The&lt;/em> Lisp book, by mr. Paul Graham himself. Hats off, hands down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ZVWUSW" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practical Common Lisp&lt;/a> — The other Lisp book, I guess? Great.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="react">
 React
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#react">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4iFXVWq" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced React: Deep dives, investigations, performance patterns and techniques&lt;/a> — I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read (or at least skimmed) quite a few books on React — I even started writing one, way back — but this is the only one I think is worth recommending. If you&amp;rsquo;re a complete beginner there are probably other/better options, but given that you&amp;rsquo;re at least semi-familiar with thinking in React, this is The One.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll add a few general programming books later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm joining Ensō!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/im-joining-enso/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 12:10:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/im-joining-enso/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-favorite-consultancy">

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s official! I&amp;rsquo;m transitioning back from &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company" >my pilgrimage as an Android developer&lt;/a>, going back to my backend roots. Ah, the glorious smell of rusty metal, engine oil and buzzing CRT monitors running nothing but &lt;code>vim&lt;/code>. The bonus is I still get to do Android! &lt;strong>More importantly, though, I&amp;rsquo;m back to working 80%&lt;/strong>. Sweet, glorious Jesus, YES! And there&amp;rsquo;s actually deeper stuff going on beneath the surface as well. Paradigm shift: √&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The End of an Era!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/back-to-the-old-gym" >Here&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s the next development plan, kind of.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Day Has Come. I&amp;rsquo;m officially archiving my previous &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan" >development plan&lt;/a> and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;m not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet. So consider this post ceremonial more than anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development plan 2021-2023</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: This plan is now archived. See &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era" >The End of an Era&lt;/a> for details.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What follows is my own personal development plan as a software engineer at
&lt;del>&lt;a href="https://vipps.io" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps&lt;/a>&lt;/del> &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a>. Some terms and
expressions are a bit internal, as they will no doubt be for you as well on your own plan (should you find yourself
inspired to write one), but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it as is. Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been at &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a> since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &amp;ldquo;Merchant Core&amp;rdquo; team. I
created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (
let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps
Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted a Vipps Community Of
Practice plainly called &amp;ldquo;Side Projects And Experiments&amp;rdquo; (SPÆ) where I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on quite a lot of exciting tech and
tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work has been with Golang and React. And
lot&amp;rsquo;s(!) of complex SQL. &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company" >In mid 2020, I decided to expand my horizon and challenge myself by doing something completely
other&lt;/a>; I learned Kotlin during my summer holidays, and joined the
Android app to learn from Norway&amp;rsquo;s best app
developers. So the Android team is where I&amp;rsquo;m at now; the ~~

Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&amp;rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both? The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else. This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to &lt;em>say&lt;/em> that you&amp;rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
