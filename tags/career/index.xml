&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to share that I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining my favorite consultancy this coming February!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much more to add, except that it feels fantastic to have signed and secured this next chapter of my future. I had some intriguing opportunities along the way, but Ensō stands out as a rare gem—not just for the excellent terms and usual perks, but especially for the amazing people who make it an extraordinary company.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Going back(end) to the old gym!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/back-to-the-old-gym/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 08:45:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/back-to-the-old-gym/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: After some heavy lifting at the old gym, I actually left Vipps and started on a Sabbatical.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s official! I&amp;rsquo;m transitioning back from &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company" >my pilgrimage as an Android developer&lt;/a>, going back to my backend roots. Ah, the glorious smell of rusty metal, engine oil and buzzing CRT monitors running nothing but &lt;code>vim&lt;/code>. The bonus is I still get to do Android! &lt;strong>More importantly, though, I&amp;rsquo;m back to working 80%&lt;/strong>. Sweet, glorious Jesus, YES! And there&amp;rsquo;s actually deeper stuff going on beneath the surface as well. Paradigm shift: √&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The End of an Era!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/back-to-the-old-gym" >Here&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s the next development plan, kind of.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Day Has Come. I&amp;rsquo;m officially archiving my previous &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan" >development plan&lt;/a> and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;m not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet. So consider this post ceremonial more than anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development plan 2021-2023</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: This plan is now archived. See &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era" >The End of an Era&lt;/a> for details.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What follows is my own personal development plan as a software engineer at
&lt;del>&lt;a href="https://vipps.io" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps&lt;/a>&lt;/del> &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a>. Some terms and
expressions are a bit internal, as they will no doubt be for you as well on your own plan (should you find yourself
inspired to write one), but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it as is. Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been at &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a> since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &amp;ldquo;Merchant Core&amp;rdquo; team. I
created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (
let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps
Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted a Vipps Community Of
Practice plainly called &amp;ldquo;Side Projects And Experiments&amp;rdquo; (SPÆ) where I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on quite a lot of exciting tech and
tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work has been with Golang and React. And
lot&amp;rsquo;s(!) of complex SQL. &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company" >In mid 2020, I decided to expand my horizon and challenge myself by doing something completely
other&lt;/a>; I learned Kotlin during my summer holidays, and joined the
Android app to learn from Norway&amp;rsquo;s best app
developers. So the Android team is where I&amp;rsquo;m at now; the ~~
eCom~~ Recurring Payments and Vipps Login subteams more
specifically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Changing Jobs Without Leaving Your Company</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company/</guid><description>&lt;p>So you&amp;rsquo;ve been at your company for a couple of years. Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&amp;rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both? The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else. This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to &lt;em>say&lt;/em> that you&amp;rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
