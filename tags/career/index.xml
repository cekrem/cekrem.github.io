I created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding.</description></item></channel></rss>
