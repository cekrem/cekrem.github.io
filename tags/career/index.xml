Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&amp;rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both? The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else.</description></item><item><title>Development plan 2021-2023</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</guid><description>What follows is my own personal development plan as a software engineer at Vipps. Some terms and expressions are a bit internal, as they will no doubt be for you as well on your own plan (should you find yourself inspired to write one), but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it as is. Enjoy!
Context I&amp;rsquo;ve been at Vipps since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &amp;ldquo;Merchant Core&amp;rdquo; team. I created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others ( let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding.</description></item></channel></rss>
