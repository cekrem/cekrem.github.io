&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s AI-powered coding assistant that can read, write, and edit code across your entire codebase.

Think of it as having an AI pair programmer that never gets tired and has read every Stack Overflow answer ever written.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
