 The Promise of Memoization

&lt;p>When React applications start to slow down, &lt;code>React.memo&lt;/code>, &lt;code>useMemo&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>useCallback&lt;/code> are often the first tools developers reach for. After all, preventing unnecessary re-renders seems like a straightforward path to better performance. But in the React ecosystem, memoization is far more complex than it first appears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how these tools actually work under the hood, the subtle ways they can fail, and when they&amp;rsquo;re truly beneficial versus when they&amp;rsquo;re just adding unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond React.memo: Smarter Ways to Optimize Performance</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/beyond-react-memo-smarter-performance-optimization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/beyond-react-memo-smarter-performance-optimization/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">

&lt;p>When it comes to React performance optimization, &lt;code>React.memo&lt;/code> is often the first tool developers reach for. It&amp;rsquo;s the hammer we grab when we notice re-render issues, and suddenly everything looks like a nail. But what if I told you that in many cases, there are simpler, more elegant solutions that align better with React&amp;rsquo;s compositional nature?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I want to explore some fundamental concepts about how React renders components and share composition patterns that can dramatically improve performance without the complexity and gotchas of memoization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Hope I Get to Write a Lot of Elm Code in 2025</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a world dominated by React, Vue, and Svelte, it might seem strange to highlight Elm – a niche language that has existed since 2012 but has had fewer releases since then than React has in a year. But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refactoring Towards Cleaner Boundaries: Lessons from Building a Markdown Blog Engine (Part 3)</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/refactoring-towards-cleaner-boundaries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/refactoring-towards-cleaner-boundaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/replacing-hugo-with-kotlin-clean-architecture" >part 1&lt;/a>, we laid out our Clean Architecture vision.

&lt;p>In my &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/replacing-hugo-with-kotlin-clean-architecture" >previous post&lt;/a>, embarked on a bold and ambitious journey to replace Hugo with a custom Kotlin-based blog engine built using Clean Architecture principles (to the letter!). Today, I want to dive deeper into the development process, specifically how I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;strong>Double Loop TDD&lt;/strong> to ensure the quality and maintainability of the system. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to go all-in, basically to see how far is too far, and to learn and explore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making a Clean Architecture Blog Engine From Scratch pt 1</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/replacing-hugo-with-kotlin-clean-architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/replacing-hugo-with-kotlin-clean-architecture/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="lets-make-a-blog-engine-ey">

&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo&lt;/a> (the stuff that I&amp;rsquo;m currently using to drive this site) is great. It&amp;rsquo;s blazing fast, feature-rich, and battle-tested. But as a developer who&amp;rsquo;s been diving deep into Clean Architecture lately (as you might have noticed from my &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/clean-architecture-and-plugins-in-go" >recent&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/interface-segregation-in-practice" >posts&lt;/a>), I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to apply these principles to a real project.

&lt;p>One of my responsibilities as an Android Developer in Vipps (Mobilepay) was to do tech interviews. After a while, I also made the tech assignments and changed the recruitment process a bit. But in the earlier days, we used a standard &amp;ldquo;build X using Y&amp;rdquo;, where &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; was modern Android tools (preferably Compose), and &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; was some non-descript hello world-ish app that did something I can&amp;rsquo;t for the life of me remember. During one of the tech task evaluations we did prior to an interview, I encountered a strange animal completely unknown to me.
