 My phone is not dumb enough
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#my-phone-is-not-dumb-enough"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been touching on the general topic of digital minimalism from time to time on this blog, not least in &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/dumbing-down-my-iphone/" &gt;the post about dumbing down my iPhone and disabling its built-in browser&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-im-not-using-the-lightphone-ii/" &gt;kind of reviewed the Lightphone II&lt;/a&gt;, and found it to be a great idea not quite making the cut when the rubber hits the(/my) road. The struggle against screen addiction and digital death is real, and it takes a great deal of intentionality to keep my various smart devices on a leash, making sure I&amp;rsquo;m the head and not the tail!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why I'm not using the Lightphone II (but my daughter is)</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-im-not-using-the-lightphone-ii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 11:09:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-im-not-using-the-lightphone-ii/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="whats-a-light-phone-and-why-are-there-two-of-them"&gt;
 What&amp;rsquo;s a Light Phone, and why are there two of them?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#whats-a-light-phone-and-why-are-there-two-of-them"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Light Phone was a seriously dumb device. No texting, only phone calls. The company behind it never meant for it to be your only device, but a device to bring when you were &amp;ldquo;going light&amp;rdquo; – detaching yourself from all the digital clutter of your everyday (social media, feeds, notifications ++). It was a big a hit as one might expect, I guess, but quite a few people found the experience delightfully refreshing – but definitely not sustainable. After all, we need a few more bare essentials than just phone calls. Right?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
