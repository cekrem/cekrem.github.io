&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering a bit with Elm lately. The super-enforced functional and minimal paradigm is very refreshing, and serves as a sort of detox after spending one too many hour stuck in Android&amp;rsquo;s not-so-lovely XML + mutating class world. Setting up a new bare minimum Elm app should be quite simple, but it turns out that there are a few more steps required than one would expect. My first instinct – being a React guy – was to try &lt;code>yarn create elm-app&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>npx create-elm-app&lt;/code>), hoping it would do the Elm-equivalent of what &lt;code>create-react-app&lt;/code> does. Turns out, to my disappointment, that the end result leaves something to be desired. No proper live-reload out of the box, and a lot of the webpack stuff I was hoping to avoid completely with Elm. Yuck.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
