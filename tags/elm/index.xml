Beyond being a useful tool, it&amp;rsquo;s also an excellent example of how functional programming languages like Elm can shine in production environments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At its core, Feedback.one is a simple but powerful tool that adds a non-intrusive feedback button to your website.

But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>create-elm-live-app – the smallest npm package ever?</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/create-elm-live-app/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/create-elm-live-app/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-problem">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering a bit with Elm lately. The super-enforced functional and minimal paradigm is very refreshing, and serves as a sort of detox after spending one too many hour stuck in Android&amp;rsquo;s not-so-lovely XML + mutating class world. Setting up a new bare minimum Elm app should be quite simple, but it turns out that there are a few more steps required than one would expect. My first instinct – being a React guy – was to try &lt;code>yarn create elm-app&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>npx create-elm-app&lt;/code>), hoping it would do the Elm-equivalent of what &lt;code>create-react-app&lt;/code> does. Turns out, to my disappointment, that the end result leaves something to be desired. No proper live-reload out of the box, and a lot of the webpack stuff I was hoping to avoid completely with Elm. Yuck.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
