 The All-Important &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#the-all-important-why"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at this Christmas lunch with some co-workers the other day, and our conversation turned – through no conscious effort of my own – towards things regarding the Christian faith, and the different terms we use and how they sometimes differ from their biblical definitions. Like &amp;ldquo;Church&amp;rdquo; – is it a building, or a group of people following Jesus? Or &amp;ldquo;Priest&amp;rdquo;, is that an occupation, something you graduate from seminary to become, or is it a general term including all of God&amp;rsquo;s people? At some point a colleague noted that &amp;ldquo;hey, Christian, you seem to be more engaged and deliberate about your faith than most people I know. Why is that?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dønn Disippel – finally in English</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/donn-disippel-finally-in-english/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/donn-disippel-finally-in-english/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My podcast &amp;ldquo;Dønn Disippel&amp;rdquo; is usually both off topic and not least &lt;em&gt;wrong language&lt;/em&gt; to mention much on this blog (though there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a link on top next to the Norwegian flag). Until now, that is! This latest episode is in English, which means I can finally show (and not just tell) my international audience some of what I&amp;rsquo;m up to. Still off topic, sure, but now you at least know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
