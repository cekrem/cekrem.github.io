Doing incremental migration is also the recommended way to introduce Elm, and luckily there are may ways to accomplish this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to combine two powerful technologies:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Elm Ports&lt;/strong>: The official way to communicate between Elm and JavaScript&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web Components&lt;/strong>: Standard, framework-agnostic UI components&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This combination gives us the best of both worlds: Elm&amp;rsquo;s type safety and predictable architecture alongside the reusability and interoperability of Web Components. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Hope I Get to Write a Lot of Elm Code in 2025</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-i-hope-i-get-to-write-a-lot-of-elm-code-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a world dominated by React, Vue, and Svelte, it might seem strange to highlight Elm â€“ a niche language that has existed since 2012 but has had fewer releases since then than React has in a year. But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
