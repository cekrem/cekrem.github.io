 Previously, on &amp;ldquo;Scary Words&amp;rdquo;

 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back I wrote about &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/functors-applicatives-monads-elm/" &gt;functors, applicatives, and monads in Elm&lt;/a&gt; – those three terrifying terms that make developers&amp;rsquo; eyes glaze over. The punchline was simple: if you&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map2&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;andThen&lt;/code&gt;, you already know these concepts. You just didn&amp;rsquo;t know they had fancy names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: I spend a lot of my day-to-day in Kotlin, not Elm. And Kotlin has its own functional programming story, largely thanks to a library called &lt;a href="https://arrow-kt.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. So I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to see how the same concepts translate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Functors, Applicatives, and Monads: The Scary Words You Already Understand</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/functors-applicatives-monads-elm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/functors-applicatives-monads-elm/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-dreaded-three"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy new year! Good to be back. What better way to kickstart this year than to scare you to death with the three most dreaded words in computer science since &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any time around functional programming communities, you&amp;rsquo;ve encountered &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. Elodin in The Kingkiller Chronicles claims there are Seven Words to make a woman love you, and there are definitely three words that make junior developers&amp;rsquo; eyes glaze over. The concepts that spawn a thousand Medium articles with titles like &amp;ldquo;Monads Explained with Burritos&amp;rdquo; (not kidding). The triforce of functional programming jargon: &lt;strong&gt;Functors&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Applicatives&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Monads&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Elm on the Backend with Node.js: An Experiment in Opaque Values</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-on-the-backend-with-nodejs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-on-the-backend-with-nodejs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;What if you could write backend logic in Elm? Not &amp;ldquo;Elm-like&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;inspired by Elm&amp;rdquo; – actual Elm, with the compiler, the types, the whole package. I&amp;rsquo;ve been nerd-sniped by this idea for a while, and last night I finally sat down to build a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This is me experimenting with a concept, not suggesting anyone &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do this. If you actually want Elm on the backend, &lt;a href="https://lamdera.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lamdera&lt;/a&gt; does something far more sophisticated – it&amp;rsquo;s a full platform with seamless frontend/backend Elm, automatic persistence, and real deployment story. My thing is&amp;hellip; not that. It&amp;rsquo;s just a hack to see what&amp;rsquo;s possible with vanilla Node.js and vanilla Elm, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cekrem/elm-form: Type-Safe Forms That Won't Let You Mess Up</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-form/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-form/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I just published &lt;a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/cekrem/elm-form/1.0.0/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cekrem/elm-form&lt;/a&gt; – a package for building HTML forms in Elm with type safety, validation, and a clean API. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever written forms in Elm (or any language, really), you know they can get messy fast. This package tries to make them less so, without including too many arbitrary batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-deal"&gt;
 What&amp;rsquo;s the Deal?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#whats-the-deal"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forms are everywhere, and they&amp;rsquo;re usually tedious to build. You need labels, inputs, validation, error handling, accessibility attributes, and somehow it all needs to stay in sync. &lt;code&gt;elm-form&lt;/code&gt; gives you a declarative way to build forms that handles the boilerplate while keeping things type-safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Organizing Files and Modules in Elm: Building an Advent Calendar</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-book-chapter-9-organizing-files-and-modules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-book-chapter-9-organizing-files-and-modules/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re officially in Part III of the book now, where we shift from systematic concept exploration to building real applications. This chapter asks you to unlearn something you probably picked up from years of JavaScript development: the instinct to split code into multiple files at arbitrary line counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/elm-for-react-devs" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the book can be found and bought @ leanpub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And as usual, the formatting is slightly more adequate in the actual book than on this Hugo blog, but we&amp;rsquo;ll make do.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>An Elm Primer: The missing chapter on JavaScript interop</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-book-missing-chapter-8-ports-interop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-book-missing-chapter-8-ports-interop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a week off from working with my book, mainly to celebrate the initial completion of parts I and II (out of IV). But it turns out I had a slight &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; connection error on my private Macbook after adding the last chapter so what I actually published was less than all of part II: chapter 8 on ports and javascript interop was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves as a reminder that the outside world is not to be trusted, and that any interaction and side-effect can (and will, from time to time) fail – even something as ordinary as a &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;. Which happens to be a major theme in the missing chapter, humbly presented to you below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter 2, Take 2: Why I Changed Course</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/chapter-2-take-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/chapter-2-take-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m rewriting Chapter 2 of my upcoming book, &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/elm-for-react-devs" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;An Elm Primer for React Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not because the original was &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;, but because the frame was off. I started by putting Elm and React side by side, trying to show “the Elm way” next to “the React way.” It felt tidy. It also pushed me into an awkward corner: either I write React the way I used to (which would undercut credibility with seasoned React developers), or I write the best React I can with everything I’ve learned from years in Elm (which would quietly disprove half my own argument). That tension is the point of this rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Elm is the Best Way for React Developers to Learn Real Functional Programming</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-book-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-book-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As my newsletter subscribers suspect and my Ensō colleagues already know by now, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started writing a book&lt;/strong&gt;. Not just any book—a practical guide for React developers who want to learn functional programming the right way, without getting lost in academic theory or Haskell&amp;rsquo;s notorious learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cekrem.github.io/images/book.png" alt="Placeholder book cover"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working title is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;An Elm Primer for React Developers: The Best Way to Learn Real Functional Programming&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, and yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a bold claim. Let me explain why I believe it. (Or go right ahead and download a free sample / buy the book on its &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/elm-for-react-devs" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;leanpub landing site&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Elm Land, Shared Subscriptions, and the Art of Workarounds</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-land-shared-subscriptions-and-the-art-of-workarounds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-land-shared-subscriptions-and-the-art-of-workarounds/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Since publishing this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a more direct approach to this problem. Check out &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-you-probably-shouldnt-use-my-elm-land-fork/" &gt;Why You Probably Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Use My Elm Land Fork&lt;/a&gt; for the follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a question that comes up occasionally in Elm Land projects: &lt;em&gt;How do I react when something in the &lt;code&gt;Shared&lt;/code&gt; model changes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple enough. You have some global state in &lt;code&gt;Shared.Model&lt;/code&gt; - maybe feature flags loaded from the backend, authentication status, or some configuration data. Your page needs to &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt; when that data changes. Not just render differently (that&amp;rsquo;s trivial), but actually perform an effect - fire off a new HTTP request, trigger some side effect locally, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Discipline of Constraints: What Elm Taught Me About React's useReducer</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-discipline-of-constraints-elm-usereducer-lessons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-discipline-of-constraints-elm-usereducer-lessons/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-accidental-teacher"&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about discipline lately. Not the &amp;ldquo;wake up at 5 AM and eat nothing but kale&amp;rdquo; kind, but the more interesting variety: the kind that comes from working within constraints that make bad choices impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending several months deep in Elm land - where the compiler is your strict but helpful mentor - I returned to a React codebase that was enthusiastically using &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; everywhere. The whiplash was immediate and instructive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HTML Helpers 2.0.0 for Elm: Stable conditionals and attributes</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/html-helpers-2-0-0-for-elm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/html-helpers-2-0-0-for-elm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in May, I introduced a tiny Elm package of HTML utilities focused on reducing boilerplate and improving readability. Since then, I’ve been using it in a few projects and gathering feedback. Today I’m releasing version 2.0.0, which finalizes the core API: concise conditionals for single elements and attribute utilities—as well as the 1.x stuff for lists.&lt;/p&gt;

And maybe you have – perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve built a todo app, explored The Elm Architecture, and fallen in love with the reliability and maintainability that comes with functional programming and strong types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But come Monday morning, you&amp;rsquo;re back to wrestling with JavaScript bugs, runtime errors, and the nagging feeling that there has to be a better way. The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t that Elm isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for production work – it absolutely is. The problem is convincing your team, your boss, or your organization to take the leap. And when you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about wholesale replacement, your boss&amp;rsquo;s skepticism might be quite healthy. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you reduce the scope, you can also reduce the risk and buy-in required. Instead of &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s rebuild our entire app in Elm,&amp;rdquo; what if the conversation was &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s try Elm for this one small widget&amp;rdquo;?

Doing incremental migration is also the recommended way to introduce Elm, and luckily there are may ways to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to combine two powerful technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elm Ports&lt;/strong&gt;: The official way to communicate between Elm and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Components&lt;/strong&gt;: Standard, framework-agnostic UI components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination gives us the best of both worlds: Elm&amp;rsquo;s type safety and predictable architecture alongside the reusability and interoperability of Web Components.
