 The Accidental Teacher
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#the-accidental-teacher"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about discipline lately. Not the &amp;ldquo;wake up at 5 AM and eat nothing but kale&amp;rdquo; kind, but the more interesting variety: the kind that comes from working within constraints that make bad choices impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending several months deep in Elm land - where the compiler is your strict but helpful mentor - I returned to a React codebase that was enthusiastically using &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; everywhere. The whiplash was immediate and instructive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HTML Helpers 2.0.0 for Elm: Stable conditionals and attributes</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/html-helpers-2-0-0-for-elm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/html-helpers-2-0-0-for-elm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in May, I introduced a tiny Elm package of HTML utilities focused on reducing boilerplate and improving readability. Since then, I’ve been using it in a few projects and gathering feedback. Today I’m releasing version 2.0.0, which finalizes the core API: concise conditionals for single elements and attribute utilities—as well as the 1.x stuff for lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to skim the exact changes from 1.3.2 to 2.0.0, here’s the comparison: &lt;a href="https://github.com/cekrem/html-helpers/compare/1.3.2..2.0.0" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1.3.2..2.0.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Compiler-Driven Development: Building an Elm Playground That Compiles in the Browser</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/compiler-driven-development-elm-playground/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/compiler-driven-development-elm-playground/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best solutions emerge from the ashes of failed approaches. This is the story of how I built &lt;a href="https://elm-playground.onrender.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;elm-playground&lt;/a&gt; – an interactive Elm environment for teaching &amp;ldquo;compiler-driven development&amp;rdquo; – and how hitting memory limits forced me to discover something even better than my original plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to host an Elm workshop at &lt;a href="https://enso.no" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ensō&lt;/a&gt; with a specific theme: &amp;ldquo;Compiler-driven development.&amp;rdquo; The idea is to showcase how Elm&amp;rsquo;s famously friendly compiler can guide your development process, catching errors before they become runtime surprises and helping you write better code through its helpful error messages.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Making Impossible States Impossible: Type-Safe Domain Modeling with Functional Dependency Injection</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/making-impossible-states-impossible-with-functional-dependency-injection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/making-impossible-states-impossible-with-functional-dependency-injection/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Most applications don&amp;rsquo;t fail because algorithms are hard—they fail because our models allow states that make no sense in the domain. &amp;ldquo;User without email but verified&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;order that&amp;rsquo;s both shipped and cancelled&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sum &amp;lt; 0&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;modal dialog both closed and active&amp;rdquo;. These states should be impossible from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most time-consuming bugs to track down are the ones where we look at our application state and say &amp;ldquo;this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kotlin's Rich Errors: Native, Typed Errors Without Exceptions</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/kotlin-rich-errors-elm-union-types/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/kotlin-rich-errors-elm-union-types/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At KotlinConf 2025, the Kotlin team showcased progress toward &lt;strong&gt;Rich Errors&lt;/strong&gt; with union types. After years of watching languages slowly adopt patterns that Elm has championed since day one, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to see Kotlin taking this significant step toward more explicit, type-safe error handling. And in a very &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; Kotlin way at that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vividly remember this announcement giving my functional heart a pleasant jolt, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found the time for a write-up until now.

And maybe you have – perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve built a todo app, explored The Elm Architecture, and fallen in love with the reliability and maintainability that comes with functional programming and strong types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But come Monday morning, you&amp;rsquo;re back to wrestling with JavaScript bugs, runtime errors, and the nagging feeling that there has to be a better way. The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t that Elm isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for production work – it absolutely is. The problem is convincing your team, your boss, or your organization to take the leap. And when you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about wholesale replacement, your boss&amp;rsquo;s skepticism might be quite healthy. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you reduce the scope, you can also reduce the risk and buy-in required. Instead of &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s rebuild our entire app in Elm,&amp;rdquo; what if the conversation was &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s try Elm for this one small widget&amp;rdquo;? Suddenly, the stakes drop dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introducing HTML Helpers for Elm</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/introducing-html-helpers-for-elm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/introducing-html-helpers-for-elm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As I continue to build more Elm applications, I find myself creating small utility functions to overcome common pain points. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of abstracting away repetitive patterns into reusable, well-named functions. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of my first public Elm package: &lt;a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/cekrem/html-helpers/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;html-helpers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-problem"&gt;
 What&amp;rsquo;s the Problem?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#whats-the-problem"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elm&amp;rsquo;s HTML API is quite straightforward - you create HTML elements as functions, pass them attributes and children, and compose them together. But a few cases come up repeatedly that can be awkward:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Better UI Components: Elm Ports with Web Components</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-ports-with-web-components/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/elm-ports-with-web-components/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I get about Elm is: &amp;ldquo;How do I integrate it with existing JavaScript ecosystems?&amp;rdquo; While Elm&amp;rsquo;s isolation is a strength, real-world projects often require working with external libraries, APIs, or UI components. Doing incremental migration is also the recommended way to introduce Elm, and luckily there are may ways to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to combine two powerful technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elm Ports&lt;/strong&gt;: The official way to communicate between Elm and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Components&lt;/strong&gt;: Standard, framework-agnostic UI components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination gives us the best of both worlds: Elm&amp;rsquo;s type safety and predictable architecture alongside the reusability and interoperability of Web Components.

Beyond being a useful tool, it&amp;rsquo;s also an excellent example of how functional programming languages like Elm can shine in production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

But right now, when frontend development is becoming increasingly complex, and clients are doing heavy lifting that previously belonged on the other side of an API call, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at what Elm does right.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
