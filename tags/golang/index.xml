 Introduction
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#introduction"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/clean-architecture-and-plugins-in-go" &gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we explored the Dependency Inversion Principle and how it enables clean, modular architectures. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into another crucial SOLID principle: Interface Segregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, kudos to Uncle Bob for reminding me about the importance of good &lt;strong&gt;software architecture&lt;/strong&gt; in his classic &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4iAc8o1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt;! That book is my primary inspiration for this series. Without clean architecture, we&amp;rsquo;ll all be building firmware (my paraphrased summary).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Clean Architecture: A Practical Example of Dependency Inversion in Go using Plugins</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/clean-architecture-and-plugins-in-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/clean-architecture-and-plugins-in-go/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: this has become a series, the next entry can be found here: &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/interface-segregation-in-practice/" &gt;Interface Segregation: Why Your Interfaces Should Be Small and Focused&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lately enjoyed revisiting the &lt;a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SOLID Design Principles&lt;/a&gt;. In the world of software architecture, few principles have stood the test of time like these. I find the &amp;ldquo;Dependency Inversion Principle&amp;rdquo; particularly interesting, as it&amp;rsquo;s one of the few that are either forgotten in modern applications, or drowned in so much over-engineering that the cost/benefit equation is offset anyways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Changing Jobs Without Leaving Your Company</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve been at your company for a couple of years. Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&amp;rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both? The most common path to take in order to learn something new, advance your career, increase your salary or simply Change Things Up A Bit involves leaving your company for something else. This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; that you&amp;rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
