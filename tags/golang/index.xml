&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve lately enjoyed revisiting the &lt;a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLID Design Principles&lt;/a>. In the world of software architecture, few principles have stood the test of time like these. I find the &amp;ldquo;Dependency Inversion Principle&amp;rdquo; particularly interesting, as it&amp;rsquo;s one of the few that are either forgotten in modern applications, or drowned in so much over-engineering that the cost/benefit equation is offset anyways.

This is especially true in tech. (Sadly, the salary part is &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> true in tech; to the point where just about the only way to get a raise is to &lt;em>say&lt;/em> that you&amp;rsquo;re leaving for a better deal, and either take the deal or the inevitable counter-offer from your current workplace. Not cool.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
