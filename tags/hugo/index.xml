And maybe you have – perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve built a todo app, explored The Elm Architecture, and fallen in love with the reliability and maintainability that comes with functional programming and strong types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But come Monday morning, you&amp;rsquo;re back to wrestling with JavaScript bugs, runtime errors, and the nagging feeling that there has to be a better way. The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t that Elm isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for production work – it absolutely is. The problem is convincing your team, your boss, or your organization to take the leap. And when you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about wholesale replacement, your boss&amp;rsquo;s skepticism might be quite healthy. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you reduce the scope, you can also reduce the risk and buy-in required. Instead of &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s rebuild our entire app in Elm,&amp;rdquo; what if the conversation was &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s try Elm for this one small widget&amp;rdquo;? Suddenly, the stakes drop dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
