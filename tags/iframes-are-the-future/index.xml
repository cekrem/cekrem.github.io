 Sick kid, but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; sick?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#sick-kid-but-not-that-sick"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was home with my oldest daughter. She had a slight cold and an Almost-Fever™, which is usually not enough to skip school by my standards, but this particular day was an outdoors day with a lot of straining physical activity. So, against my potential better judgment I let her stay home, but warned her that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be quite a spa – some chores and a little school work was to be expected. She gladly accepted my terms, well-raised and polite as she indeed is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
