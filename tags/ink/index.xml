Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it.</description></item><item><title>Exploring UIs in the terminal part 1: React/Ink</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1/</guid><description>Where do UIs belong? Most of us consider ReactJS a tool for rendering UI components on the web (or the DOM, specifically), and if by &amp;ldquo;React&amp;rdquo; we mean &amp;ldquo;ReactDOM&amp;rdquo; then we&amp;rsquo;re right. But as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with React Native, React is not confined to the DOM at all, and can render to any number of environments. After all, like it says on the box, React is a &amp;ldquo;JavaScript library for building user interfaces&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
