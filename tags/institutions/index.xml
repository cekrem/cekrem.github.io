When those people leave (or never understood it in the first place), the theory dies, and you&amp;rsquo;re left with a codebase that works but nobody truly comprehends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this more, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe the problem goes deeper than individual developers losing their edge. It&amp;rsquo;s not just that &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; are losing the ability to build theories. It&amp;rsquo;s that the &lt;em&gt;institutions&lt;/em&gt; where theory-building happens—our teams, our companies, our profession—are being systematically degraded.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
