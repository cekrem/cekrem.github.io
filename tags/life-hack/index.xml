 My phone is not dumb enough
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#my-phone-is-not-dumb-enough"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been touching on the general topic of digital minimalism from time to time on this blog, not least in &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/dumbing-down-my-iphone/" &gt;the post about dumbing down my iPhone and disabling its built-in browser&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/why-im-not-using-the-lightphone-ii/" &gt;kind of reviewed the Lightphone II&lt;/a&gt;, and found it to be a great idea not quite making the cut when the rubber hits the(/my) road. The struggle against screen addiction and digital death is real, and it takes a great deal of intentionality to keep my various smart devices on a leash, making sure I&amp;rsquo;m the head and not the tail!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free at last – dumbing down my iPhone and disabling all evil!</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/dumbing-down-my-iphone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 13:35:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/dumbing-down-my-iphone/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;
 The problem
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#the-problem"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I need a phone, for a couple of obvious reasons. What I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; want is a smart phone killing my brain and soul, constantly bashing at my presence and peace of mind. Needless to say I&amp;rsquo;ve tried countless options and variations, but all my attempts have been less than ideal. My attempts usually fail in one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Math test for staying home with semi-sick kids</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/math-test-for-home-schooling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 13:35:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/math-test-for-home-schooling/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sick-kid-but-not-that-sick"&gt;
 Sick kid, but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; sick?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#sick-kid-but-not-that-sick"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I was home with my oldest daughter. She had a slight cold and an Almost-Fever™, which is usually not enough to skip school by my standards, but this particular day was an outdoors day with a lot of straining physical activity. So, against my potential better judgment I let her stay home, but warned her that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be quite a spa – some chores and a little school work was to be expected. She gladly accepted my terms, well-raised and polite as she indeed is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
