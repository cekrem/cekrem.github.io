 I&amp;rsquo;m not that addicted. Am I?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#im-not-that-addicted-am-i"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use agents for coding. &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym" &gt;I love my craft far too much&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;ve of course tried it. But every time I felt the worse for it afterwards, learned less than nothing, and &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/" &gt;ended up with code I neither owned or understood completely&lt;/a&gt;. Yuck. Nevertheless, LLMs have been sneaking into various workflows without my being completely intentional about it. My mantra has been to use it like Python scripts, &amp;ldquo;to automate (or simplify/streamline) the boring parts&amp;rdquo; while keeping it at arms length from everything I truly care about. But &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; is a woolly and dynamic term, and I find myself growing lazy in more ways than I&amp;rsquo;d planned, as well as more easily bored. I suspect my brain is shutting down various faculties whenever I don&amp;rsquo;t bother finishing a sentence in my notes, summarizing longer parts of text or wraiting slopppy because some LLM will proof read things afterwards anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like when Frodo slips on his ring to get out of a tough spot. It seems to solve an immediate problem quite efficiently, but every time Sauron closes in (and it&amp;rsquo;s actually &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; worth it).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
