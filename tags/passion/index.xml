 I&amp;rsquo;m not that addicted. Am I?
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#im-not-that-addicted-am-i"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use agents for coding. &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/coding-as-craft-going-back-to-the-old-gym" &gt;I love my craft far too much&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;ve of course tried it. But every time I felt the worse for it afterwards, learned less than nothing, and &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/" &gt;ended up with code I neither owned or understood completely&lt;/a&gt;. Yuck. Nevertheless, LLMs have been sneaking into various workflows without my being completely intentional about it. My mantra has been to use it like Python scripts, &amp;ldquo;to automate (or simplify/streamline) the boring parts&amp;rdquo; while keeping it at arms length from everything I truly care about. But &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; is a woolly and dynamic term, and I find myself growing lazy in more ways than I&amp;rsquo;d planned, as well as more easily bored. I suspect my brain is shutting down various faculties whenever I don&amp;rsquo;t bother finishing a sentence in my notes, summarizing longer parts of text or wraiting slopppy because some LLM will proof read things afterwards anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like when Frodo slips on his ring to get out of a tough spot. It seems to solve an immediate problem quite efficiently, but every time Sauron closes in (and it&amp;rsquo;s actually &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; worth it).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Craftsman Mindset: Lessons from Four Weeks Offline</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/craftsman-mindset/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/craftsman-mindset/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I just returned from four weeks of vacation—no laptop, no programming books, and a phone that could barely do more than call and text. It’s the longest I’ve been away from code in years. I didn’t plan to make it a digital detox, but it turned out to be exactly what I needed. If you do get a chance to do the same, I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something clarifying about stepping away from the things that usually fill your days. For me, that meant no late-night debugging, no “just one more chapter” of a programming book, and no side projects. Instead, I spent my sitting-down time reading more fiction, playing more Zelda, and generally letting my mind wander more than usual. It was good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Passion</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/passion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/passion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Friday, and I&amp;rsquo;m up at 4am, wide awake, head filled with thoughts on recursive data structures and how to efficiently deal with them in our client&amp;rsquo;s Elm application. I tried going back to sleep for a few minutes, but decided against it. My (Garmin) sleep score averages well above 90%, so I can deal with one slightly short night. &lt;em&gt;If I can just solve this puzzle&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;ll be more than worth it! I&amp;rsquo;m doing test driven development on this particular problem. Not because I want to be fancy or make a point, but out of necessity – the complexity is far beyond what I would entrust myself without some guard rails while I iterate on it. &lt;strong&gt;It feels great&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to the Sabbath moment when I can behold the work of my hands and see that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
