I tried going back to sleep for a few minutes, but decided against it. My (Garmin) sleep score averages well above 90%, so I can deal with one slightly short night. &lt;em>If I can just solve this puzzle&lt;/em>, it&amp;rsquo;ll be more than worth it! I&amp;rsquo;m doing test driven development on this particular problem. Not because I want to be fancy or make a point, but out of necessity – the complexity is far beyond what I would entrust myself without some guard rails while I iterate on it. &lt;strong>It feels great&lt;/strong>, and I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to the Sabbath moment when I can behold the work of my hands and see that it was good.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
