&lt;p&gt;The Day Has Come. I&amp;rsquo;m officially archiving my previous &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan" &gt;development plan&lt;/a&gt; and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;m not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet. So consider this post ceremonial more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Development plan 2021-2023</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: This plan is now archived. See &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/the-end-of-an-era" &gt;The End of an Era&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is my own personal development plan as a software engineer at
&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="https://vipps.io" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vipps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a&gt;. Some terms and
expressions are a bit internal, as they will no doubt be for you as well on your own plan (should you find yourself
inspired to write one), but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it as is. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;
 Context
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#context"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been at &lt;a href="https://vippsmobilepay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vipps MobilePay&lt;/a&gt; since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &amp;ldquo;Merchant Core&amp;rdquo; team. I
created a few small backend services from scratch (a very fun QR code generator, to name one), deprecated a few others (
let&amp;rsquo;s not name those ever again&amp;hellip;), helped kick off the Vipps Design System and most significantly worked on the Vipps
Merchant Portal and on automating merchant signup, risk analysis and onboarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted a Vipps Community Of
Practice plainly called &amp;ldquo;Side Projects And Experiments&amp;rdquo; (SPÃ†) where I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on quite a lot of exciting tech and
tried a few non-mainstream programming languages. Still 90% of my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work has been with Golang and React. And
lot&amp;rsquo;s(!) of complex SQL. &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/changing-jobs-without-leaving-your-company" &gt;In mid 2020, I decided to expand my horizon and challenge myself by doing something completely
other&lt;/a&gt;; I learned Kotlin during my summer holidays, and joined the
Android app to learn from Norway&amp;rsquo;s best app
developers. So the Android team is where I&amp;rsquo;m at now; the ~~
eCom~~ Recurring Payments and Vipps Login subteams more
specifically.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
