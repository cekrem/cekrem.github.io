The Day Has Come. I&amp;rsquo;m officially archiving my previous development plan and moving on to new adventures in Vipps Mobile Pay! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved most of the goals I set out to achieve. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to proceed towards the next chapter. I&amp;rsquo;m not, however, ready to make a new plan just yet.</description></item><item><title>Development plan 2021-2023</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/devplan/</guid><description>Update: This plan is now archived. See The End of an Era for details.
What follows is my own personal development plan as a software engineer at Vipps Vipps MobilePay. Some terms and expressions are a bit internal, as they will no doubt be for you as well on your own plan (should you find yourself inspired to write one), but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it as is. Enjoy!
Context I&amp;rsquo;ve been at Vipps MobilePay since 2018, mostly doing work that now belongs in the &amp;ldquo;Merchant Core&amp;rdquo; team.</description></item></channel></rss>
