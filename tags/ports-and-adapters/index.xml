But it turns out I had a slight &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; connection error on my private Macbook after adding the last chapter so what I actually published was less than all of part II: chapter 8 on ports and javascript interop was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves as a reminder that the outside world is not to be trusted, and that any interaction and side-effect can (and will, from time to time) fail – even something as ordinary as a &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;. Which happens to be a major theme in the missing chapter, humbly presented to you below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
