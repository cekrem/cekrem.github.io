Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it.</description></item><item><title>Exploring UIs in the terminal part 1: React/Ink</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1/</guid><description>Where do UIs belong? Most of us consider ReactJS a tool for rendering UI components on the web (or the DOM, specifically), and if by &amp;ldquo;React&amp;rdquo; we mean &amp;ldquo;ReactDOM&amp;rdquo; then we&amp;rsquo;re right. But as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with React Native, React is not confined to the DOM at all, and can render to any number of environments.

Your parents tell you to stick around for another five, but other people in tech - and your adventurous self - tell you it&amp;rsquo;s about time to learn something new. What if you could do both?

The one type I didn&amp;rsquo;t get was the standard chocolate one that&amp;rsquo;s most common these days. While I&amp;rsquo;ve not consistently been very good at paying this forward, I do make an effort some years to do something a bit different for my wife. Yes, my wife; the kids get standard ones :P This year&amp;rsquo;s plan was simple: create an online calendar with cozy favors, encouragements and the like each day until Christmas.</description></item></channel></rss>
