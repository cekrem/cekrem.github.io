 Abandon ship, all y&amp;rsquo;all
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#abandon-ship-all-yall"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://cekrem.github.io/posts/do-more-stuff-cli-tool-part-1" &gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I made a small POC cli tool for doing multiple things in parallel. Like curling multiple endpoints and collecting the responses in a neat and tidy list instead of opening several terminal tabs/panes. The goal was partly to explore how rendering actually works in a more confined environment than the DOM (web), or more complicated yet: native mobile apps. The other goal, as usual, was to have fun while doing it. My adventures in part 2 have, however, been slightly shipwrecked.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
