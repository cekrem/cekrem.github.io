 What&amp;rsquo;s a Light Phone, and why are there two of them?

&lt;p>The original Light Phone was a seriously dumb device. No texting, only phone calls. The company behind it never meant for it to be your only device, but a device to bring when you were &amp;ldquo;going light&amp;rdquo; – detaching yourself from all the digital clutter of your everyday (social media, feeds, notifications ++).

After all, we need a few more bare essentials than just phone calls. Right?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
