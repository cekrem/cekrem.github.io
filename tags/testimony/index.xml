 The All-Important &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#the-all-important-why"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at this Christmas lunch with some co-workers the other day, and our conversation turned – through no conscious effort of my own – towards things regarding the Christian faith, and the different terms we use and how they sometimes differ from their biblical definitions. Like &amp;ldquo;Church&amp;rdquo; – is it a building, or a group of people following Jesus? Or &amp;ldquo;Priest&amp;rdquo;, is that an occupation, something you graduate from seminary to become, or is it a general term including all of God&amp;rsquo;s people? At some point a colleague noted that &amp;ldquo;hey, Christian, you seem to be more engaged and deliberate about your faith than most people I know. Why is that?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
