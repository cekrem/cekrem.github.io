Context The Vipps App – until recently – took about 45 minutes to build on A$ure Azure. With a weekly release schedule, that might not sound like a huge dealbreaker, but since we&amp;rsquo;re using a &amp;ldquo;feature branch&amp;rdquo; approach to how we do git (ie no develop branch; master should always be deployable-ish), we don&amp;rsquo;t allow merging anything to master without a successful cloud build.</description></item></channel></rss>
