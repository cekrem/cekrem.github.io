&lt;p&gt;Not because the original was &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;, but because the frame was off. I started by putting Elm and React side by side, trying to show “the Elm way” next to “the React way.” It felt tidy. It also pushed me into an awkward corner: either I write React the way I used to (which would undercut credibility with seasoned React developers), or I write the best React I can with everything I’ve learned from years in Elm (which would quietly disprove half my own argument). That tension is the point of this rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My new project, and some of what's ahead</title><link>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/my-new-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cekrem.github.io/posts/my-new-project/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dear-subscriber"&gt;
 Dear subscriber

 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten about you. Quite the contrary – I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to let you know (in a meaningful way) why there have been fewer posts lately. And, to be clear: neither have I stopped writing (again, quite the contrary). I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to disclose quite yet what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say this much: It starts with &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;, and ends with &amp;ldquo;OOK&amp;rdquo;. &lt;del&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIctVM0KbIU" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Forging a Billhook&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
